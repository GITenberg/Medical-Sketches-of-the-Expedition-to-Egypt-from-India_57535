<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>In consequence of orders, from the
Court of Directors to the Government
in India, it became my duty to give
some account of the health of the troops
employed on the late expedition from
India to Egypt, and to describe the prevailing
diseases.</p>

<p>The sources of information, to which
I had recourse, were the reports made to
me, and an extensive correspondence
with the medical gentlemen of the army;
particularly those employed in the pest-establishments.
Besides these, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
my situation, at the head of the medical
department of the army from India, gave
me access, other sources of information,
regarding the plague, were open to me,
as a Member of the Board of Health in
Egypt.</p>

<p>Some may think the present a very
short, and many may think it an incomplete
account; but, I trust, it will not be
found incorrect. I have purposely avoided
doubtful speculations and hypotheses.
Anxious, above all things, to adhere
closely to facts, and keep these unmixed
with any notions of my own, I have, in
most cases, published the extracts from
letters to me, without altering a word of
the correspondence.</p>

<p>Of the numerous imperfection of these
Sketches, I am abundantly sensible.
The life of a medical man in the army
is at no time very favourable to literary
pursuits; mine has been peculiarly unfavourable;
and I have had little time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
or opportunity, since I first entered the
army, to attend to the ornaments of diction.
For the last fifteen years of my
life; mostly spent in the East Indies,
West Indies, or at the Cape of Good
Hope; sometimes at sea, sometimes on
land; my time has been occupied in a
laborious attention to my duty in the
army.</p>

<p>Some necessary avocations oblige me
to dismiss this tract in a more imperfect
form than it might have appeared
in, perhaps with more leisure.
As it is, it conveyed to government, in
India, all the information which they required;
and I must mention, that it
comes before the public very nearly in
the state in which I presented it as a
report in India. From materials in my
possession, I could have enlarged most
parts of it, and rendered the whole more
complete; but, when I drew up the following
account in India, it never occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
to me, that my imperfect Memoir
would be the only medical account of
the Egyptian expedition. I expected,
on my arrival in England, to have found
complete histories of the climate and diseases
of Egypt, during the time that it was
occupied by the English, from some of
the medical staff of the British army;
several of whom were known to be fully
equal to the task. If any of these gentlemen
should hereafter give to the world
the medical history of this renowned
campaign, my Memoir may stand in some
stead: it gives some facts and it will
supply some information to which no one
but myself had access.</p>

<p>At the present moment, I have not
leisure to enlarge or alter it; and some
friends, who have seen the manuscript,
press its publication at the present
time.</p>

<p>In the execution of my duty, during
a long and perilous voyage, and alter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
most fatiguing marches, I sometimes
laboured under difficulties; but my duty
was in every instance much facilitated,
and it would be unjust in me not to mention
it. I acknowledge my obligations
to all the medical gentlemen of the
Indian army, by whom I was most cordially
and well seconded in all that I
undertook.</p>

<p>From the nature of the prevailing diseases,
the campaign in Egypt was, in a
particular degree, a service of danger.
To their regret, the Indian army arrived
too late in Egypt to share in any other
dangers than those arising from the diseases
of the country; and here, the medical
gentlemen had the post of honour.
The zeal, attention, and perseverance,
displayed, particularly by those employed
in the plague-establishments, deserve
every praise. Nothing can so powerfully
incite the exertions of medical men,
in such circumstances of danger, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
consciousness of co-operating with the
best and most enlightened of mankind,
for the alleviation of human misery. Intrepidity
is more a military than a medical
virtue; but seldom I believe has
there been a greater display of it than
among the medical officers, in Egypt,
whose duty it became to reside in the
pest-houses.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>There are two names which I cannot
pass over with general praise. At a
period of universal alarm, and of real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
danger, when the plague was committing
the greatest ravages, two gentlemen stepped
forward, and generously volunteered
their services in the pest-houses.
It so happened, too, that, from their acquirements,
these two were the best calculated,
of any in the army, to succeed
in this dangerous duty. Dr Buchan
had acquired a perfect knowledge of the
disease in the former year; and while on
duty at the pest-house, at Aboukir, had
got the infection there, soon after the
memorable landing of Sir Ralph Abercrombie.
Mr Price had made the history
of the plague his particular study, and,
from his acquaintance with the oriental
languages, was peculiarly calculated to
be master of every thing relating to it.
As will be seen hereafter, in the execution
of his duty at El-Hammed, he, likewise,
caught the infection. To the exertions
of these two gentlemen, the service
owes much; their country very much. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
would fain hope, that from them, who are
so able to do it, we may look for something
like a history of the plague in
Egypt.</p>

<p>Dr Shapter, who was for some time in
charge of the medical department of the
Indian army, and who succeeded Mr
Young, as head of the medical staff of
the English Army, deserves our thanks
for his very ready accommodation on
every occasion, and compliance with
every request for assistance, and for many
things, of which an army which had traversed
an immense desert was necessarily
destitute.</p>

<p>Thus far I have discharged debts which
I felt that I owed. I must add a few
words more, in explanation.</p>

<p>To some, it may appear that, in the
following Sketches, I have given too
large a space to the journal; and that I
have been too copious in my extracts
from letters. Both of these are, no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
to many, dry and uninteresting; but, as
statements of facts, from which every
one can form deductions for himself, as
they stand, they appeared to me much
more useful than any conjectures which
I might hazard to advance. It is to be
feared that, too often, facts and details
are made to bend to preconceived opinions
and theories.</p>

<p>On the causes of diseases, I have dwelt
a shorter time than to some may have
appeared necessary. But I thought that,
while the general causes of the diseases
of soldiers and sailors have been so ably
handled by a Pringle and a Lind, a
Cleghorn and a Huxam, a Blane and a
Hunter—from me, little could be expected.
All that appeared necessary for
me to do, was, to assign the extraordinary
causes—those incidental to the expedition,
or peculiar to Egypt; those, in
fine, which rendered the service treated
of different from former services, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
on the continent of Europe, or in tropical
climates.</p>

<p>It will be observed, that the diseases
which occurred in the Indian army were
but few; and, except on the plague, I
detain the reader but a short time on
this part of my subject. A long description
of the symptoms, or of the history,
of dysentery, diarrhæa, hepatitis, or ophthalmia,
appeared to me superfluous;
when, besides the very clear and perfect
nosological account of the illustrious
Cullen, we have many complete histories
of these diseases, in books which are in
the hands of every person.</p>

<p>Finally: in justice to myself, and in
extenuation of errors in these Sketches, I
must mention, that, when they were preparing
for the press, I laboured under
many and very considerable disadvantages.
I was on duty in a remote corner
of the kingdom, and have been, necessarily
from the same reason, at a distance
from the press, since, and while the
printing went on: circumstances which,
I hope, will conciliate the indulgence of
readers in general, and shield me from
the severity of criticism.</p>

<h1><i>MEDICAL SKETCHES, &amp;c. &amp;c.</i></h1>

<h2 id="PART_I">PART I.</h2>

<p>In complying with the orders of government
in India, I have sincere pleasure in being
able, from original documents, to present
them with a correct account of the
diseases and mortality which occurred in
their army during the late expedition to
Egypt. From the period of the first sailing
of the expedition, and my appointment to
the medical superintendance of it, I retained
both the reports of the different medical
gentlemen employed in it, and my own
memorandums written on the spot. During
the period in which Dr Shapter acted, and
until I was re-appointed, I likewise kept
states of the sick and mortality of the army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and thereafter, till the return and landing
of every corps of the army at Calcutta,
Madras, and Bombay, or at Ceylon.</p>

<p>The India government has ever been
peculiarly anxious about every thing that
related to the health of their troops, zealous
in collecting any fact and circumstance
touching the causes of diseases or the means
of obviating them, and most liberal in every
thing that regarded the health of the sick
soldier.</p>

<p>During an uncommonly long voyage, in
a march over extensive deserts, and in a
country and climate described as the most
inimical to the human race, the Indian
army enjoyed a considerable degree of
health, and suffered but a small mortality.
The causes of this I shall attempt to develope:
the investigation may be useful.</p>

<p>The prevention of disease is usually the
province, and is mostly in the power, of
the military officer; the cure lies with the
medical: in the expedition to Egypt very
much was done by both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The medical officers deserve my grateful
thanks, and I readily acknowledge my
obligations to them. For every assistance
in their power, I am under not fewer
obligations to the military officers. In no
army, perhaps, was the health of every
soldier in it more the care of every officer,
from the general downwards, than in the
Indian army.</p>

<p>It would be doing violence to my feelings
not to mention how much my duty
was abridged by having such a commander-in-chief
as General Baird. His military
abilities are well known. His extreme
attention to every thing which regarded the
health and comfort of the soldier, I must
mention, was a principal cause of the
great degree of health enjoyed by the
army.</p>

<p>To Brigadier-General Beresford the army
owes very much likewise. It is not my
business to say how much all were indebted
to the man, who, under circumstances the
most discouraging, led the advance over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the desert. In my official capacity I cannot
but notice how much the British army,
as well as that from India, were indebted
to him, as President of the Board of Health,
and as Commandant of Alexandria. The
excellent police established by him gave
security to the army as well as to the
inhabitants; and, more than any other
circumstance, tended to the exclusion of
the plague from Alexandria.</p>

<p>The route which we took from India to
Egypt is remarkable for having been that
by which, in the earliest ages, the commerce
of Asia, its spices, its gums, its
perfumes, and all the luxuries of the East,
were conveyed to Tyre, Sidon, Carthage,
Rome, Marseilles, and in a word to all
the coasts of the Mediterranean, from
Egypt, a country rendered extremely interesting
by various recollections.—The situation
of the army from India has accordingly
excited no common share of interest.</p>

<p>It penetrated Egypt by a route over the
desert of Thebes, a route unattempted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
any army for perhaps two or three thousand
years. Independently of late circumstances,
Egypt and Arabia peculiarly interest
every man of science, and more particularly
medical men, from the occurrence of
the plague, and the ophthalmia, or the disorder
of the eyes, in Egypt.</p>

<p>On one account the situation of the
Indian army in Egypt is not a little curious.
It consisted of about eight thousand men;
of which number about one-half were
natives of India, and the other half
Europeans. We have often seen the
changes effected on a European habit by
a removal to a tropical or to a warm
climate, but not, till now, the changes in
the constitution of an Asiatic army brought
to a cold climate: for such were the bleak
shores of the Mediterranean to the feeble
Indian.</p>

<p>The following Sketches I have divided
into three parts. The first gives the medical
history, or rather the journal, of the
expedition: in the second, after attempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to assign the causes of the diseases which
prevailed, some modes of prevention are
offered: and in the third there is some
account of the diseases.</p>

<p>The first division of the army intended
for the expedition to Egypt, under Colonel
Murray, sailed from Bombay in January,
1801. Their voyage was rather a tedious
one, and the small-pox and a remittent
fever broke out among them. They
touched for refreshments at Mocha and at
Jedda, and on the 16th May, 1801, came
to anchor in Kossier-bay; the prevailing
winds in the Red Sea, at this time, rendering
it impossible to get so far up as Suez.</p>

<p>The second division of troops, (originally
intended for another service,) under Colonel
Beresford, sailed from Point de Galle, in
Ceylon, on the 19th February; and on the
19th May disembarked at Kossier.</p>

<p>The last division, under Colonel Ramsay,
sailed from Trincomalée, in Ceylon. They
were later of arriving at Kossier, and were
not able to cross the desert before July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>At Kossier there is a fort and a town, if
they deserve the name. They are built of
mud, and the Arabs inhabit them only at
the season when caravans arrive with the
pilgrims for Mecca, and with corn for that
and the other ports on the opposite Arabian
coast.</p>

<p>Like every other place described by Mr Bruce,
that we have seen, we found Kossier
most accurately laid down by that traveller
in lat. 26° 7″, and long. 34. 04.</p>

<p>Kossier is situated on the western coast of
the Red Sea. Here, vessels for the expedition
were daily arriving, and the troops
in general landed in a very healthy condition.
In one column of an annexed
table, intended to show the diseases and
mortality of the army, will be seen the
strength of the different corps employed in
that service.</p>

<h3>JUNE, 1801.</h3>

<p>At the beginning of this month we were
in camp near the village of Kossier. Soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
after the arrival of the troops at Kossier, all
were attacked with a diarrhœa, occasioned
by the water, which contained much
sulphate of magnesia. At first it greatly
debilitated the men; but, as they became
used to it, the water ceased to affect the
bowels. On the whole it appeared to
have produced salutary effects, and the
army was, for some time, uncommonly
healthy.</p>

<p>On the 19th, the 88th, with two companies
of the 80th regiment, under the
command of Colonel Beresford, as the
advance of the army, commenced the
march across the desert. Having the
digging of wells and other duties to perform,
the advance did not reach the banks
of the Nile until the next month. The
rest of the army marched on the following
days, the marches being always performed
by night; and the army, with a very inconsiderable
loss, reached the banks of the
Nile in a very healthy state. The course
which we took was nearly that travelled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Mr Bruce. For a considerable way after we
left Kossier, the road had the strongest resemblance
to the bed of a river. As we advanced
from Kossier, the water became daily less
salt, and less bitter. At Le Gita, and at Bir
Amber, the two stations nearest to Ghenné,
it was not much complained of.</p>

<p>The winds in Kossier camp, from nine to
twelve o’clock, generally blew from the
N. W. accompanied with torrents of sand.</p>

<p>On the march, a very hot suffocating wind
from the W. set in about ten and continued
till three o’clock. The thermometer at Kossier
could not be attended to.</p>

<p>On the 29th, at Le Gita, in my tent, at
three P. M. the mercury stood at 114°. In
the soldiers tents it could not have been less
than 118°. At six o’clock in the morning,
in a well three feet deep, it was at 69°; and,
after taking it out, it fell to 63°: but evaporation
must have had a share in the reduction.
In other places, on the march, the degree
of heat must have been higher. Le
Gita is not a situation favourable to the centration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of heat: it is situated in a large
open plain of many miles extent.</p>

<p>There was but little sickness in this month,
and yet almost every exciting cause existed.
The heat was intense. In the currents of
dust, much of it went into the stomach and
lungs, and occasioned nausea, which was
likewise occasioned by the destructive hot
wind. To this the Arabs and even the camels
always turn their backs. The men
were frequently exercised, and the duties
of fatigue in India, usually done by black
natives, were performed at Kossier by the
soldiers. The fatigue on the march has perhaps
never been exceeded in any army.
Diarrhœa, and a few cases of ophthalmia,
and nyctalopia, were the only diseases in the
army. The native corps from Bombay were
recovering from a fever, with which they
landed. These corps were the last that
crossed the desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<h3>JULY.</h3>

<p>During almost the whole of this month,
the army was encamped on the banks of the
Nile, which now began to overflow its banks,
near Ghenné. On the opposite bank are the
magnificent ruins of Tentyra, or Dendira, and
the fine temple of Isis. The situation of the
army near Ghenné was very healthy. There
was excellent water, and an abundant market
of vegetables, of fruit, and of the best provisions.
We prepared to move, and detachments
of the army went up to Thebes, Luxor,
and to the cataracts, to press all the boats.
About the end of the month, the army
began to move to Lower Egypt. The 10th
regiment marched to Girgé, the capital of
Upper Egypt, sixty miles below Ghenné.</p>

<p>On the 27th and following days, the rest
of the army was embarked in boats. The
wind at Ghenné was not regular from any
quarter, and sand was blown from all quarters,
particularly at the time of the springs.
The thermometer had a wide range at Ghenné.
In my marquee from 71° to 108°.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 20th, it rose to 110°. In the open
air the heat was from 70° to 115°. There
was more sickness than in the last month.
There were several cases of hepatitis, particularly
in the 10th regiment, and cases of dysentery
were not unfrequent towards the end
of the month. In the beginning a considerable
number of cases of fever appeared,
and not a few of ophthalmia and pneumonia:
but all these soon did well, after being removed
to a good hospital. The Catchief,
the officer next in rank to the Bey, gave up
his own house for an hospital, and General
Baird likewise gave up his quarters to the
sick.</p>

<h3>AUGUST.</h3>

<p>By the 12th of this month, the greater
part of the army, after a navigation of the
Nile, of nearly four hundred miles, arrived
at Damietta, where we found one regiment of
the English army, the 89th, and a general
hospital, under charge of Dr Franks, the inspector.
The troops at first were put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
quarters there; but an encampment was afterwards
formed on Rhoda, a small island
made by the Nile, very nearly in the centre
between Cairo and Ghiza. The Nilometer
is on this island. As they landed, the troops
were uncommonly healthy. Most of the
hepatic and dysenteric sick had recovered
on the passage, and the only disease with
which they landed was slight fever, of
which the cases were not numerous. This
state of health continued but a very short
time after the landing. In the course of the
first week, most of the corps sent one-twelfth
and some one-tenth of their strength to the
hospital.</p>

<p>In three weeks, the sick of the army exceeded
one thousand. A considerable number
of ophthalmic cases appeared, but the prevailing
disease was fever. In every corps it
prevailed, and very few escaped it. In general
it was of short duration, of two, three,
or five, days at most, and rarely proved fatal.
Ghiza appeared then to have been an unhealthy
quarter, and the ground of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
encampment was found to be swampy. We
found the 89th regiment in garrison at this
place, and so very sickly was that corps, that
they could not muster fifty men on the parade.
The sick of the army was sent into
Ibrahim Bey fort, pleasantly situated on the
bank of the river on the Cairo side. It had
been occupied by the enemy as an hospital,
and had been completely fitted up by them
for the purpose. But it was neither (if accounts
could be believed) a healthy nor a
safe situation. A little before our arrival, the
French had some cases of the plague in a
ward of this hospital. On hearing this,
every measure of precaution was taken, and
the disease did not appear. It was remarked,
that those sent to the hospital, ill of ophthalmia,
dysentery, and hepatitis, rarely left it
without an attack of the prevailing fever.</p>

<p>About the end of the month, preparations
were making to embark the army for Rosetta,
and not less than twelve hundred sick
were embarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>During the month the wind was most frequently
from the N. The thermometer on
the Nile, from the 1st to the 8th, was higher
than we had found it at Ghenné. In the fort
of Ibrahim Bey it moved from 80° 50″ to
90°. The sickness of the month was very considerable.
Though we lost several men,
yet the loss bore but a small proportion to the
sickness that prevailed. Much of the sickness,
and many of the deaths which subsequently
occurred, we could trace to the situation
near Cairo. Many cases of hepatitis
did not appear, but of late many of dysentery;
and, in some corps before quitting
Cairo, ophthalmia prevailed very generally.</p>

<h3>SEPTEMBER.</h3>

<p>Early in this month, the greater part of
the army was encamped in the neighbourhood
of Rosetta. The 86th regiment and
two companies of the 7th Bombay regiment
went into garrison at Ghiza. Separate regimental
hospitals were provided for every corps
in Rosetta: but the number of sick appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to be gaining ground, particularly the cases
of ophthalmia, which disease was nearly confined
to the 10th and 88th regiments. The
number occurring in the artillery, 61st and
80th regiments, was inconsiderable; and the
disease was very rarely seen among the Sepoys.
Dysentery and hepatitis prevailed
very generally in every corps; but the appearance
of another disease occasioned the
greatest alarm throughout the army.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th, I discovered
a case of the plague in the hospital of the
88th regiment: Anthonio, one of the hospital-cooks,
who had for thirty hours laboured
under febrile symptoms, shewed me two
buboes in his groins. He had no venereal
appearance, and the fever was now attended
with extreme irritability of the stomach. At
the same time, I was shewn another hospital-servant,
a Hallancore, who lay next to
Anthonio. The Hallancore had been attacked
in the night time, and, when I saw him, had
much fever and pain in the axilla, though I
could discover no swelling of the glands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
As speedily as possible these two men, and
six other hospital-servants, who slept in the
same apartment, were removed to a house at
the extremity of the town. A room was immediately
allotted, in the hospital of the 88th
regiment, for cases under observation.</p>

<p>To this every soldier, or follower, with
febrile symptoms, was sent the instant that the
symptoms were discovered. A minute examination
was made, on the evening of the
14th, of all the men in the hospital,
amounting then to one hundred and sixty-two,
in order to discover whether any laboured
under suspicious symptoms, but nothing
was observed.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th, I discovered
six men with fever, most of them had been
attacked in the night-time; they were sent
without delay into the observation-room, and
most strictly guarded. By frequent observation,
in the course of the day, I discovered
buboes in one, and pain in the axillary and
femoral glands of all the others: all were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
therefore sent to the pest-house, which was
now established.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 16th, the cook
and Hallancore, first attacked, died. It was
found necessary in the course of the day to
send nine more men into the observation-room,
where the nitrous fumigation was very
liberally used. After an emetic, I gave mercury
very liberally to the whole nine; but
the symptoms, on the morning of the 18th,
were so unequivocal, that I sent them all to
the pest-house.</p>

<p>Our situation now became very alarming.
There were the clearest proofs of the hospital
which the 88th regiment occupied being
thoroughly infected, consisting of about fourteen
or fifteen rooms, but all the cases had
hitherto come only from three of the rooms.
Lamps for the nitrous fumigation were kept
constantly burning both in them and in the
observation-room. A very large building
was procured near Rosetta; and, with all possible
haste, the men were moved to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>No man left the old hospital till all his
clothes were washed; his hair was cut
short, and himself bathed. On coming to
the outside walls of the new hospital, every
man stripped himself naked and went into
a warm bath before his reception into the
hospital. He was then provided with new clothing
and bedding; the clothing brought
with him was received by a non-commissioned
officer, who saw it repeatedly washed
and baked, after which it was received
into the hospital store-room. On the evening
of the 18th, I sent four more men
into the observation-room, and, on the 21st,
three of them were sent into the pest-house.
The other did well in the observation-room.</p>

<p>On the 23d, Littlejohn, a boy, was sent
in the morning to the observation-room,
having been attacked the night before with
rigours. On the 25th, Egan, another suspicious
case, was also sent there. In both of
them a severe ptyalism was excited in less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
than forty-eight hours by mercury and
nitric acid, and they afterwards did well.</p>

<p>On the 28th, Craig, with febrile symptoms,
was sent from the new hospital to the
observation-room of the old. His gums
were speedily affected; but it was found
necessary to send him to the pest-house.
This was the only instance of the plague
which appeared in the 88th regiment after
their removal to the new hospital.</p>

<p>The six native followers, first sent off,
had no symptoms of the disease for eight
days after their arrival at the pest-house;
but, on the 9th and 10th days after, all of
them were attacked, and none survived the
attack three days. Four more of the Indian
servants, sent to the pest-house to attend
the others, shared the same fate.
The case of the Mukadum of the Dooli-bearers
was the most rapid.</p>

<p>On the 17th, he was attacked about nine
o’clock in the morning with rigours, and
died before four o’clock. No instances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the plague appeared in any other corps of
the army during this month. Though they
attempted to conceal it, we discovered that
some <i>accidents</i> (as they call it) had occurred
about the beginning of September
among the people of the town.</p>

<p>The weather still continued the same
during this, as the whole of last, month.
The same winds prevailed, without rain or
anything remarkable. On the 15th, 16th,
and 17th, it blew from the westward: after
this, we had close calm weather.</p>

<p>After the 15th, the Nile at Rosetta began
to recede. The general range of the thermometer,
in a house in Rosetta, was from
73° to 83° 50´.</p>

<p>After the plague, the most formidable
disease in the army, from its general prevalence,
was ophthalmia. In the 10th and
88th regiment there were upwards of three
hundred and fifty cases. The total number
in the army exceeded six hundred. Dysentery
and hepatitis prevailed very generally
among all the European corps; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
mortality of the month was very considerable.</p>

<h3>OCTOBER.</h3>

<p>In the beginning of this month, the
encampment was moved from one to five
miles distance from Rosetta. The hospitals
were gradually removed also from hence.
As the men recovered they were sent to a
convalescent camp, intermediate both to
Rosetta and the general encampment, and
precautions were taken to prevent the men
from intermingling with the inhabitants of
Rosetta.</p>

<p>Thatched regimental hospitals were built
in the camp; and, though in the middle
of a desert, the sick soldier had a warm,
comfortable, and well-ventilated, apartment,
and was liberally provided with every thing
conducive to his recovery. Early in the
month, the garrison of Damietta joined the
army. The 86th regiment were healthy
and suffered less from ophthalmia than any
European corps of the army. About the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the month, this corps was sent to Ghiza,
and the detachments in garrison there were
ordered to join their respective corps.</p>

<p>The temperature of the air became sensibly
lower than in the former month, the
extremes being from 69° 50´ to 80°. The
medium was from 70° to 77°. The westerly
was still the prevailing wind, and it often
blew very fresh. The atmosphere, towards
the end of the month, was very cloudy; and,
though we had no rain during the month,
it seemed often to threaten it. Owing to
the very strict precautions taken, little plague
occurred during the month.</p>

<p>From the time the sick of the 88th regiment
were separated, and from regulations
regarding cleanliness and fumigation being
rigidly adhered to, the progress of the contagion
was effectually suppressed in that
regiment. The European corps still continued
to suffer from hepatitis and dysentery,
while the number of cases of ophthalmia,
and the great degree of violence in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
this disease was now seen, were really
alarming.</p>

<p>During the month, a case of the plague
appeared in the 61st regiment. He had
been a patient in the regimental hospital
in Rosetta, and caught the disease from
straggling through the town. The only
other case which occurred was a follower
of the commissariate department.</p>

<h3>NOVEMBER.</h3>

<p>At the commencement of this month,
the army was encamped at El Hammed.
The sick were in the thatched buildings, and
the mortality bore but a small proportion to
the sickness. The 86th regiment were very
healthy in Ghiza. The weather during
the month was different from what we had
experienced for a considerable time. The
sky was constantly clouded, and it often
blew strongly from the west. It rained on
fifteen days, and the quantity of rain which
fell during the month was considerable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
On the 17th, there was much thunder and
lightning. The dews were heavy, and
there was generally a thick fog which
lasted till eight or nine in the morning.
The extreme ranges of the thermometer in
my marquee were from 57° to 77°.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the month, the whole
sick of the army amounted to one
thousand three hundred and fifty, or
more than one-fourth part of the whole
strength of it. In the course of the month
there appeared one hundred and seventy
cases of intermittent fever, occasioned evidently
by the effluvia from the low
ground between the camp and the river,
which retained the rain, and, before we
moved, became a swamp.</p>

<p>On the 8th, we were again alarmed at the
appearance of a case of the plague, in
the department of the commissary of cattle,
which was immediately put under quarantine.
On the 12th, symptoms of the
disease appeared in a Sepoy of the Bengal
battalion, who was in the hospital of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that corps. On the 13th, five more cases
were discovered in the same hospital, which
was ordered to be burnt, the sick having
been removed into a large house near Rosetta,
where the same precautions were
used as with the 88th regiment, when the
disease first broke out. After their removal,
no case appeared in that battalion. On the
12th a case of small-pox was discovered in
the hospital of the 10th regiment; and, in
the course of two days more, four cases
appeared in the same hospital. The first,
a Portugueze servant, died. At the end of the
month, the number of sick was reduced. In
the weekly return from the 20th to the 26th,
there were six hundred and thirty-two Europeans,
and three hundred and eighty Sepoys,
making a total of one thousand and twelve.</p>

<p>None of the tents kept the rain well out,
which was often heavy. The sand, however,
quickly absorbed it in most places.
The fever was, in several instances, similar
to a type, which we had been little used to,
viz. the typhoid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h3>DECEMBER.</h3>

<p>Early in this month part of the army
marched to Alexandria; and, by the end
of it, all the army, with the exception of
the horse-artillery, 7th Bombay regiment,
and the department of the commissary of
cattle, was collected there. About the
time that the first part of the army
marched thither, detachments of the 26th
dragoons, and of Hompesch’s mounted
riflemen, joined us from the English
army, and were quartered in Rosetta.
The plague now gained on us.</p>

<p>On the 1st of the month, Corporal
Francis, of the 88th regiment, who had
been on the pest-house guard the day
before, complained of slight febrile symptoms
and giddiness. He had a vibex on
the seat of the inguinal glands on one
side, with some pain, but no swelling
there. I shewed him to Mr Price, who
was in charge of the pest-house, and he
had no doubt of its being a case of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
plague. Very soon after his admission
into the pest-house, a bubo appeared in
his groin, and his fever increased. Mercury
was thrown in rapidly, his mouth
became affected, and, the bubo suppurating,
he recovered.</p>

<p>On the 15th, a private of the 8th light
dragoons was shewn to me with a bubo
in his groin and giddiness, but without
quickness of pulse or any other febrile
symptom. On being brought to Mr Price
he was admitted into the pest-house, and
the treatment and result in him were
similar to those of Francis.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 15th, it being
reported to me that a Sepoy had suddenly
died of fever in the line of the 7th
Bombay regiment, I examined the body,
and found the inguinal glands swelled on
both sides. About an hour after, Mr Grisdale,
the surgeon, shewed me a case in
the hospital of the same corps, which
was evidently the plague, and which I
instantly ordered to the pest-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of the month 38 more
cases of the same disease, most violent
and rapid in their progress, appeared in
the same regiment. Three died, either in
the hospital or on the lines, before they
could be conveyed to the pest-house, and
one died in his way thither. One man
of the 1st Bombay regiment died of the
same disease, who had clearly got the
contagion from the former corps, near
which their hospital was situated.</p>

<p>The weather during the month was
changeable; towards the end it was
boisterous. The thermometer in tents was
sometimes so low as 49°, and rarely rose
above 70°. The sky was cloudy, but
rain fell only once in eight days. In the
beginning of the month there was a considerable
number of cases of continued
fever. There were fewer intermittents
than in the last month. The number of
cases of dysentery was decreasing.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the month there
were many cases of catarrh, pneumia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and rheumatism. The diseases of the
eyes were greatly on the decline. In the
weekly return of the 3d are three hundred
and twelve cases, whereas in that of
the 31st there appear only ninety eight.</p>

<h3>JANUARY, 1802.</h3>

<p>With the exceptions already mentioned,
all the army, during this month, was in
Alexandria, where they attained a degree
of health they never had at Rosetta. No
case of the plague had been known at
Alexandria when the Indian army arrived
there; and the strictest precautions were
taken to cut off the communication with
Rosetta and the 7th regiment.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the month the
weather was extremely boisterous: the wind,
generally from the north and north west,
was very high. For eleven days there was
rain, and often very heavy. The thermometer
was once below 60°, and never
above 70°, in a house in the centre of the
city. The number of sick was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
smaller, but the mortality greater, than in
any preceding month. On the 1st, Mr
Price, who was in charge of the pest-house
near Rosetta, was himself attacked with the
disease, which with him proved very violent.</p>

<p>On the following day, three of six Arabs,
who acted as in-servants to the pest-house
near Rosetta, were also attacked.</p>

<p>On the 6th, a Sepoy of the 1st Bombay
regiment died suddenly in the hospital of
the corps at Alexandria; the sick of this
corps having arrived from Rosetta but a
few days before.</p>

<p>On the 7th, two cases of the plague,
from the same regiment, were detected in
the camp at Alexandria.</p>

<p>On the 8th, the 1st and 7th Bombay
regiment marched to, and encamped at,
Aboukir-bay, where a pest-establishment
was placed for them.</p>

<p>On the 2d, symptoms of the plague
were discovered on Dr Whyte, who the
day before had inoculated himself, and he
died on the 9th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>On the day following, a soldier of the
61st regiment, a servant of Colonel Barlow,
Commandant of Rosetta, was sent into the
pest-house there, now under the charge of
Mr Grisdale and Mr Rice, with the plague.</p>

<p>On the 13th, two of six Arabs, out-servants
at Rosetta, were attacked with the
disease. Two men of the department
marched the same road, and halted at the
same stages, as the 7th regiment had done
a week before.</p>

<p>On the 22d, two men of the 10th
regiment, from a permanent guard on-board
a vessel under quarantine, were sent into
the pest-house at Alexandria. There occurred
this month 72 cases of the plague
in the Indian army, viz.</p>

<p>Continued fever prevailed in the army.
It was the synocha of Cullen. Intermittents
were still on the decline, as were
likewise dysentery and hepatitis. Pneumonia
and rheumatism prevailed but in
a small degree.</p>

<h3>FEBRUARY.</h3>

<p>This was a very cold and wet month;
yet the number of sick continued to decrease,
except in the 1st and 7th regiments,
in which corps the plague continued to
rage. Throughout the month, the sky
was cloudy; we had high winds, on 19
days it rained, and on some of these as
heavily as in the monsoons in India. The
thermometer moved between 55° and 63°.
On the 13th, for the first time, the following
cases of the plague were dismissed
cured from the quarantine-hospital; viz. two
Sepoys, one drum-major, and one woman,
from the 7th regiment, and two Arab
servants of the pest-house. At this period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
too, six were dismissed from the pest into
the quarantine-hospital.</p>

<p>Till this day no native of India, who
had entered the pest-house, ever returned.
But so much was the dread of the distemper
now lessened, that a volunteer
in-steward, for the pest-house at Aboukir,
came forward from the 7th regiment.</p>

<p>On the 24th, the commissary’s clerk at
Rosetta got the disease. Of five Europeans,
whom we had left at Rosetta, two caught
it and died. The disease here raged with
the utmost violence.</p>

<p>On the 28th, Signior Positti, an Italian,
came from Rosetta, and lodged at the
house of Mr Fantouchi, the Swedish
consul in Alexandria. It was discovered
two days after that he had the plague,
and he, with the surgeon attending him,
was immediately sent to the Lazaretto.
Signior Positti died on the day of his
admission. Almost all the cases of plague,
which subsequently appeared in Alexandria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
could be traced to this case as a
source.</p>

<p>The whole number of cases of plague,
which occurred in the army during this
month, was only twenty one. Fever appeared
in all the reports. It was accompanied with
the inflammatory diathesis, and it was
in general slight.</p>

<p>Of hepatitis and dysentery, the number
of cases was still less than in former
months. Ulcers, which in the Indian
army were hitherto very rarely seen, prevailed
at this period. Of rheumatism
and pneumonia there was an increase.</p>

<p>On the whole, in the course of the
month, there was a decrease of sickness,
and a considerable decrease of the mortality.
On the 1st of the month there
were seven hundred and five in the report;
and on the 28th only three hundred and
twelve, or about one in twenty-six.</p>

<h3>MARCH.</h3>

<p>The weather was milder than in February.
The thermometer was gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
on the rise. During the month it never
was lower than 50° nor higher than 69°.
The wind was most frequently from the
west, from which quarter it blew very
strongly on the 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th,
19th, 20th, and 21st. It rained on 12
days; and on some of them, about the
middle of the month, very heavily. The
atmosphere was in general cloudy. On
the 19th we had claps of loud thunder.
But for the existence of the plague the
army might be said to have been very
healthy during the month; and, though
this disease was more diffused through the
country and in the army, yet more cases
did not occur in the Indian army than in
last month, and the mortality from this
disease was much less considerable than
formerly.</p>

<p>The garrison of Ghiza had been, for
some time, the most healthy part of the
army. During the present month the
corps there presented long reports of sick.
The small-pox broke out among the Sepoys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
there; and in the 86th regiment there
was an immense number of venereal cases,
several of which, from their standing,
were inveterate.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the number
sick of the plague in March.</p>

<p>The spreading of the diseases rendered
it necessary to multiply our pest-establishments.
In addition to those of Alexandria,
Rosetta, and Aboukir, one was formed
at Ghiza, and one at Rahamania, situated
on an island at that part of the Nile where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the canal of Alexandria formerly took
its rise. Between Aboukir and Rosetta, a
serjeant and twelve men, of the 26th
dragoons, were stationed to prevent communication
between Alexandria and Rosetta.
Nine of these were attacked with
the disease during this month. Within
the walls of the pest side, or that part of
the lazaretto appropriated for the reception
of cases of plague, at Alexandria, a
serjeant and twelve men were also posted
as a guard to preserve order. Eleven of
them caught the disease in the present,
and the rest in the following, month.
They were volunteers from the 10th, 61st,
and 88th, regiments, and appear in the
above list. The source of this disease
appeared to be clearly in Signior Positti.
Four of the Arab servants who
attended him were seized; and the Board
of Health obtained an order that no more
soldiers should be sent on so dangerous
a duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 2d, a deserter from the queen’s
German regiment, taken up in Alexandria,
was sent to the provost’s guard. He had
only come to Alexandria a few minutes
before he was discovered. He complained
of being ill; and, on being visited by
Mr Blackwell, inspecting surgeon of
plague-cases to the Board of Health, it
was found that his disease was the plague.
He was immediately conveyed to the
lazaretto, and all the prisoners at the provost’s
guard were brought to the observation-ground,
and the provost with his guard
were sent to the quarantine-ground. The
deserter died a few minutes after his arrival
in the pest-house. His case was one of
the most inveterate.</p>

<p>On the 14th, Broughman O’Neal, one
of the prisoners sent from the provost’s
guard, having symptoms of the plague,
was sent by Mr Cloran, who was in
charge of the observation-side, in to Mr
Price, who was in charge of the pest-side,
of the lazaretto. On the 17th a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
case of the plague was detected in the
hospital of the regiment De Roll. The
infection could not be traced; however
the surgeon and the sick in the hospital
were put under quarantine.</p>

<p>On the 19th a case was detected in the
hospital of Dillon’s regiment, and the
hospital of that corps was also put under
quarantine. On the 16th, one of nine
Lascars, attached to Major Falconer, deputy
quarter-master general, was attacked with
the plague at Rahamania. The major
had only arrived there from Rosetta a
few days before. Subsequently, the
remaining eight Lascars, and two of the
Major’s servants, caught the contagion,
and every one of them died. On the
26th a private of De Roll’s regiment was
sent from the observation to the pest side
of the lazaretto; and, on the same day,
a sailor, belonging to the agent of transports
near Aboukir, was sent into the
pest-house, as was also a man of the
Royal Artillery from Aboukir-castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Of fever there occurred but a very few
cases during the month, and the disease
was a very mild one.</p>

<p>Of five cases of small-pox two died,
both of which were natives of India. Of
hepatitis and dysentery there appear fewer
cases, and of the total number more than
one half were from the 61st regiment;
and all the severe cases were of that corps.
Of ulcers the number still continued to
be considerable and increasing.</p>

<h3>APRIL.</h3>

<p>At the commencement of this month
affairs wore a very unfavourable aspect.
The plague, which first appeared in Rosetta,
and had hitherto, with little exception,
been confined to that place, at
the present period had travelled as far as
Aboukir on the one side, and as far as
Rahamania on the other side, of Alexandria;
and we had information that most
of the intermediate stages, betwixt us and
these two places, were infected. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
so much severity did the disease rage at
Rosetta, that, at the end of last month,
it was found necessary to withdraw the
commandant and every person from it,
and the inhabitants shut themselves up.
From information received by the Board
of Health, they likewise found it necessary
to place all those coming from Cairo and
Ghiza under quarantine.</p>

<p>It was well known, that, in Upper
Egypt, the plague was making dreadful
ravages among the Mamalouks. The few
cases which occurred in Alexandria made
every one alert there, and a very strict
police was kept up in the town by the
commandant and by the Scorbatchie.</p>

<p>The weather in the beginning of the
month was variable. The thermometer
rose a little. It was rarely so low as 60°,
and only once as high as 71° 50″. We
had much high wind on twelve days. It
rained on fifteen days, but the quantity
which fell was not so great as in the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
month. The sky was cloudy throughout
the month.</p>

<p>On the 20th there was much loud
thunder.</p>

<p>On the 1st, sixty-four invalids, from the
Indian army, were embarked for England.
The greater part were cases of
blindness.</p>

<p>Both Mr Price and Mr Rice, who dissected
the body of Signior Positti in the
lazaretto, had been ill ever since; and this
day they were so ill that Dr Buchan was
sent in to relieve Mr Price, and Mr Moss
to relieve Mr Rice.</p>

<p>On the 3d, a case of the plague appeared
at Ghiza on a private follower,
and another case was detected in the hospital
of the 26th Dragoons at Alexandria.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 14th, Mr O’Farrel,
who had charge of the pest-house at
Aboukir, was attacked with the disease.
This day all the hospitals were moved out
of town, and encamped under the walls
of Alexandria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 6th, a Jewess dropped down
dead in the streets of the city, and it was
discovered that she had been ill for four
days of the plague. Her husband, who
concealed it from the Board of Health,
was bastinadoed; and afterwards was sent,
with his whole family, into quarantine.
On the same evening an Arab’s family
reported that one of them was ill of the
plague. The person affected was sent to
the pest-side, and the rest of the family
to the observation-ground, of the lazaretto.</p>

<p>On the 7th, Mr Dyson, who on the 4th
went to Aboukir to relieve Mr O’Farrel,
discovered bubo and symptoms of the
plague in himself.</p>

<p>On the 10th, a serjeant of the 61st,
who had had the disease last month, and
who, after recovering, officiated as in-steward
of the pest-house in Alexandria,
was again attacked with the plague.</p>

<p>On the 11th Mr Angle died, being the
fourteenth day of his disease. He, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
weeks before, went to assist Dr Buchan
in the lazaretto.</p>

<p>On the 14th, symptoms of the disease
were first discovered on Mr Moss in the
lazaretto. Of the Jew family sent to the
observation-ground on the 6th, which
amounted to seven persons, two were sent
to-day to the pest-side.</p>

<p>On the 15th the husband of the jewess
died in an observation-tent, having glandular
swellings, which were not discovered
till after his death. He did not appear to
be ill. Mr Cloran was accustomed, once
a day or oftener, to examine those under
observation, but nothing was discovered
to ail this man.</p>

<p>On the 16th, he discovered some symptoms
of the disease in another of the same
family, and sent him in to Dr Buchan.</p>

<p>On the 17th, a deserter from the 61st
regiment, sent to the regimental guard-house,
where he was discovered to have
the plague, was sent to the lazaretto, and
the guard, amounting to nineteen persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
into the observation-ground of the lazaretto.
This man confessed that he had
slept one night near the pest-house at
Aboukir. On the 19th Mr Moss died.
On the 24th the plague was discovered
in another Jew family. The plague of
the Indian army, during the month, was
as follows, viz.</p>

</table>

<p>On the whole, it was a pleasing circumstance
to see so little of the disease among
the native corps, as, when it did occur,
it proved so much more fatal to them.
From my correspondence with different
gentlemen in the pest-houses it appears,
that, during the month, bubo was not so
constant a symptom, and that carbuncles
were now frequent.</p>

<p>At first this symptom was seen in no
case. Excepting the 61st regiment, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
army was in a very healthy state. Fever
was equally mild as in last month. Opthalmia
began again to appear. In the
last return there were sixty cases, fifty of
which were Europeans. Of seventy-one
men with ulcers, sixty were Europeans.
The total sick of the army, at the end of
the month, did not exceed three hundred;
and in this are included every ulcer, accident,
or less serious complaint, which prevents
a soldier from appearing on parade.</p>

<h3>MAY.</h3>

<p>At the commencement of this month
the principal part of the army was still
encamped at Alexandria. On the last day
of April orders arrived from England to
General Baird, to return with his army
to India, and to detach the 10th, 61st,
and 88th, regiments, which were placed
on the British establishment.</p>

<p>On the 3d the Indian army began the
march to Ghiza, where it remained encamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
by the pyramids for some days,
until water and the passage over the desert
were reported to be ready. At length the
march commenced with the sick.</p>

<p>We crossed the river, encamped at
Boulac, set off from Cairo, and, passing
the ruins of Heliopolis, made Birket El Hadje
our first stage. Our marches over the
desert of Suez, as in crossing the great
desert, were all performed during the
night, and we always encamped by sunrise
in the morning. Luckily there had
much rain fallen before we marched; and
at one place in the middle of the desert,
and again at Suez, we found large collections
of rain-water, from which all were
well supplied.</p>

<p>By the end of the month the whole
corps, except the 7th Bombay regiment,
had crossed the desert and arrived at Suez.
Part of the army was encamped near the
town of Suez, and part at Moses Wells,
nine miles on the eastern side of the Red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Sea. The march over the desert of Suez
was performed with much greater ease
than that over the desert of Thebes. The
weather was cool and favourable, the hot
winds were less felt, and we found abundance
of good water provided at the
different stations. At the time of our
arrival we found Suez very healthy.
Though the plague had travelled as far
as Cairo and all the neighbouring villages,
it had not reached Suez till the
arrival of the army.</p>

<p>The women and children of the army,
as well as some invalids, were here; and
they, with the Lascars of the fleet, were
under the medical charge of Dr Colquhoun
and Mr Waring, whose reports had all
along shewn a very great degree of health.
The only disease was the tropical dysentery,
and this was confined to the women and
children, who were inactive. The Lascars,
who were actively employed, were all very
healthy. During the month, several cases
of the plague were reported, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
were all very mild. On the 4th, a Sepoy
of the 1st Bombay regiment, on duty with
the pioneers in the desert, was attacked
with the disease, and was the only man
who died of it during the month. On
inquiry afterwards, it was found that the
Sepoy had got the infection from one of
the interpreters, named Peter, and that
Peter brought the disease from the Turks
in Cairo. The case of the interpreter was
so mild, that it was treated by Mr Dick
as a venereal complaint. He took
mercury to produce salivation, the bubo
came to suppuration, and Peter recovered.
As soon as the Sepoy died in the desert,
every article belonging to him was burnt
with the body. A perfect separation was
effected, and every precaution taken in
consequence. No other case appeared in
this detachment.</p>

<p>On the 12th, another case appeared in
the 7th regiment, now encamped at a
village opposite Boulac. No plague could
be discovered to have been in the village.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
The occurrence of this case, therefore,
could be accounted for in no other way
than that the seeds of the disease still
lurked in this very unfortunate corps, and
that they brought it from Aboukir with
them. A pest-house was established under
the charge of Dr Henderson at Boulac,
and two other mild cases were admitted
into it towards the end of the month.</p>

<p>On the 23d, the disease was discovered
on a Madras tent-Lascar at Moses Wells.
On the 26th it was discovered on a serjeant
of the 86th regiment in crossing the desert.
This was the last case which appeared
previous to the embarkation of the army.</p>

<p>The weather, during the month, was
uncommonly fine. The thermometer was
greatly on the rise. During the month it
was from 60° to 68°: at Alexandria from
60° to 78°: in the tents on the desert, and
at Moses Wells, from 60° to 98°. The
wind was generally from north to north-west.
In the desert, and at Moses Wells,
we had the dry suffocating wind that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
found in the desert of Thebes, at Kossier,
at the same time in the former year; and
the atmosphere was generally cloudy. The
army was very healthy.</p>

<p>Ophthalmia now, however, became a
more frequent disease, particularly among
the Europeans, and it might be said to be
the only disease which prevailed.</p>

<h3>JUNE.</h3>

<p>On the 2d, the embarkation commenced,
and by the 15th the whole army was embarked,
and had sailed for the different
presidencies, except the 7th regiment,
which, on account of the plague still prevailing
in it after the rest of the army had
embarked, was ordered to remain two
months. Most of the corps in the army
embarked in the most healthy state. There
was hardly a sick man, except a few cases
of the venereal disease which had resisted
mercury.</p>

<p>To conclude, never, perhaps, was there
an army embarked for any service more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
healthy than the Indian army was when it
re-embarked on its return from Egypt.</p>

<p>Previously to the arrival of the army
from Egypt, in order to provide against the
introduction of the plague into India,
quarantines were established at the presidencies
of Bombay, Bengal, and Madras,
as well as at the island of Ceylon. The
principal of these was at Butcher’s island,
near Bombay, where there were pest and
quarantine establishments, of which, on
my arrival in June, I took the charge.
At this period, letters from Dr Short, at
Bagdad, and from Mr Milne, at Bassorah,
described the plague as raging in Persia,
and particularly at Ispahan and Bagdad:
in consequence of this information every
vessel, both from the Red Sea and Persian
Gulf, was ordered to Butcher’s island.</p>

<p>As the ships arrived, the troops from the
Red Sea were landed; but the artillery,
86th regiment, 1st Bombay regiment, and
the commissariat department, were so uncommonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
healthy, that I detained them
but a very few days on the island.</p>

<p>The 7th Bombay regiment landed at
Butcher’s island in August. As this was
the corps in which the plague had principally
prevailed, though they were not
unhealthy, I judged it prudent to detain
them a month. On my last inspection of
them before they left the island, of a total
of seven hundred, including Sepoys, their
wives, and the public and private followers
of the corps, I found only four sick, and
these I believe were all catarrhs.</p>

<p>Dr Henderson, with the pest-establishment,
and all those whom we had left at
Suez, arrived at Butcher’s island on the
1st September. The convalescents from
the plague, as well as the guard, and the
pest-house servants, were, on their arrival,
all of them very healthy; but I thought
it safe to keep them in quarantine on the
island till October, when, like all the
others who had been in quarantine, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
were provided with new clothing and sent
over to Bombay.</p>

<p>The company’s packets from Bassorah,
and the vessels which arrived from the
Persian Gulf, had none of them the least
suspicious appearance, and I found that
their crews were all very healthy.</p>

<p>I had likewise the satisfaction to receive
accounts from the medical gentlemen employed
in the expedition, after their arrival
at Calcutta, Madras, and Ceylon: their
accounts were so late as November. In
none of the corps did any death occur
from the time of embarkation at Suez. The
deaths which appear in the annexed table,
in the 80th regiment, were men lost in
the wreck of one of the transports.</p>

<h2 id="PART_II">PART II.</h2>

<p>From my own observation, from accurate
reports made to me, as well as from an
extensive correspondence with the medical
gentlemen of the Indian army in Egypt,
I have presented a faithful, and I believe
an accurate, narrative of the medical
occurrences of the late campaign.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be thought that I have
descended to a great degree of minuteness:
however, I conceive, that, from the facts
stated, important and useful deductions
may be made. I think it a matter of regret
that such journals are not more frequently
kept; with a little industry on the part
of the profession they might always be so.
Had such records been always faithfully
kept, many practical points would not, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
they now are, be involved in doubt and uncertainty.
We should not now be so ignorant
of some diseases, of the countries where
we have so often made campaigns, or of
which we have so long been in the possession.</p>

<p>Humble as the labours may seem, and
confined as the abilities of an individual
may be, were he only faithfully to relate
observations made with care, to compare
them with those of his contemporaries, and
by these to correct the opinions of his
predecessors, he would perform no mean
service to his art.</p>

<p>I shall, in this part, advert to what appeared
to be the principal causes of the
diseases which prevailed. Previously to
this it will be necessary to take notice of
the state of the different corps, composing
the army, as they landed at Kossier.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Sepoys from
Bombay, every corps disembarked at Kossier
in the most healthy state. Rarely,
indeed, have troops on any expedition been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
landed in the degree of health in which
the Indian army landed in Egypt.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that their situation
on ship-board was the cause of the sickness
which prevailed among the troops from
Bombay. The Sepoys were but a short
time encamped at Kossier when they began
to recover; yet the situation there was by
no means what we would recommend, or
make choice of, for the recovery of health.</p>

<p>The army under General Baird was composed,
as already observed, very nearly of
one half Europeans, and of one half
natives of India. We shall begin with the
Europeans.</p>

<p>A detachment of the Royal Artillery
came with Sir Home Popham from the
Cape of Good Hope, where they had
been stationed for nearly four years. The
Honourable Company’s artillery, collected
from the different presidencies in India,
had all of them been a considerable time
in that country. Of the artillery, the
Bombay suffered the most; next to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the Royal; next the Madras; then the
Bengal; and, least of all, the horse-artillery.
The prevailing diseases were dysentery
and hepatitis. At one period,
indeed, fever prevailed among the Bombay
artillery.</p>

<p>The troop of the 8th Light-Dragoons
was landed in a very healthy state, and
continued healthy throughout. The dragoons
came from the Cape of Good Hope,
where the regiment had been for five years.
The only man they lost in Egypt was from
hepatitis.</p>

<p>The 10th foot had been a short time at
Madras and had been two years stationed
in Calcutta, whence they were embarked
for Egypt. At Calcutta this regiment was
at first very unhealthy, and lost a number
of men; but they landed in a most healthy
state at Kossier. The 10th regiment, but
for having lost their way, and making some
prodigious marches across the greater desert,
would have suffered less, perhaps, than any
other corps. In consequence of this march,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
soon after they reached Ghenné, a number
of cases of fever appeared, all of which
terminated either in hepatitis or in dysentery.
Half the sick of the army, on leaving
Ghenné, was from the 10th regiment; and
the diseases contracted by their march
across the desert continued, at Rosetta, to
croud their sick-reports for four months
after.</p>

<p>The 61st regiment was, in several respects,
the finest corps in the army. The
men were all young and very healthy, and
the regiment joined the army in a state
of high order and discipline. They came
from the Cape of Good Hope, where the
body of the regiment had been for nearly
three years. This regiment continued
healthy till they were encamped at El
Hammed, and they lost very few till they
came to Alexandria. They were quartered
in the Pharos, and the surgeon attributed
much of the sickly state of the regiment
to the situation of this quarter. The situation
is indeed a very damp one, surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
every where by the sea, except on the
side of the mound which connects it with
Alexandria. However, this corps had not
yet lost those men which every corps loses
on its arrival in a warm climate, and which,
in some shape, seems necessary to their
naturalisation to it. The diseases by which
the 61st regiment suffered were dysentery
and hepatitis; and, after their arrival in
Alexandria, they were wont to lose, on an
average, four men a week, for some time.</p>

<p>The 80th regiment came from Trincomalée,
in Ceylon, a very unhealthy station,
and where, during a five-years stay, they
lost a very great number of men. This
regiment was very healthy on landing. It
was composed of what are usually termed
old Indians; draughts from the 36th, 52d,
71st, and 72d, regiments, which had been
sent home after a stay of fifteen or twenty
years in India. The 80th suffered most
of their loss after crossing the desert. At
Ghiza, at El Hammed, and at Alexandria,
they were the most healthy corps. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
there were many old men in this
regiment who never recovered the fatigue
of the march, nor the illness at Rhoda
island, and who felt most severely the cold
weather at Alexandria. A fact regarding
this corps deserves mention. Mr Brown,
who was in charge of it, informed me,
that many men, who, at Trincomalée,
were never free from liver-complaint, and
were almost always in the hospital with this
disease, never complained at Alexandria.
This fact, on inquiry, I found held good
in most other corps, and I had observed
many instances of it in the 88th regiment.</p>

<p>The 86th regiment landed in a healthy
state. This regiment had been six years
in a warm climate. They came from
Bombay, where they had been in garrison
for the two last years. They continued
very healthy till they were encamped at
Rhoda island; there, and at El Hammed,
they suffered much: subsequently, no corps
in the army suffered less or lost fewer. The
frequent movements of this corps contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to their being in a more healthy
state than some other corps were.</p>

<p>The 88th regiment had been about three
years in a warm climate. They likewise
came from Bombay. This regiment crossed
the great desert with the loss of only one
man. They were very healthy at Ghenné,
and continued so till their arrival at Rhoda.
The 88th was the first regiment from the
Indian army that arrived at Ghiza, where
they found the 89th regiment, and the
ophthalmic hospital of the English army.
In the course of the first week after their
arrival at Ghiza, the 88th regiment sent
one fourth of their strength into the hospital;
all of them cases of fever or ophthalmia.
At El Hammed, in proportion to the
strength of this corps, ophthalmia prevailed
more in it, and the regiment suffered more
from it, than any other corps, except the
10th regiment. It will be remembered,
too, that it was in the 88th regiment that
the plague first broke out; and this regiment
had more cases and more deaths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
from it than any other European corps.
Mr Tonrey and myself, who attended these
first cases, were among the few medical
men who were exposed to the contagion
and came in contact with the patients, and
yet escaped the disease. The 88th regiment
became at last one of the most healthy
corps in the army. From the 1st December,
1801, to the 1st May, 1802, they
only lost two men; of these, one was from
the plague, and the other from sudden
death, cause unknown.</p>

<p>With the exception of the two Bombay
corps, all the native Indians lost fewer
men than the European corps. After they
marched from Kossier, and till the plague
appeared in the two Bombay battalions,
where it committed the greatest ravages,
they were the two most healthy corps in
the army.</p>

<p>The Bengal volunteer-battalion, composed
of volunteers for the expedition to
Egypt, from different regiments of Sepoys
in Bengal, was a fine body of men, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
they were mostly what are called old or
made soldiers. They were in general very
healthy, and during the campaign their
loss was very inconsiderable. Though the
plague at one time appeared in this corps,
yet, by the system established throughout
the army by this time, and by the active
vigilance of the officers of the corps, the
contagion was extinguished; and, though
the plague prevailed in every other corps,
it never subsequently visited this battalion.</p>

<p>The Artillery-Lascars were, on the whole,
very healthy throughout the campaign.
The few deaths which they had were from
dysentery.</p>

<p>The 1st Bombay regiment, after recovering
from the fever contracted on ship-board,
continued healthy, and suffered few deaths
but from the plague. It was remarked,
that this corps effected the march across
the desert of Thebes, as well as that over
the isthmus of Suez, with less difficulty
than any corps in the army. In general,
we observed that the native troops endured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
this better than the European. It ought
not to be forgotten, that, under Captain
Mahoney, detachments from the native
corps were employed, some time before
the march of the army, in clearing the
roads, digging wells, and on other duties
of fatigue more harassing than any that
fell to the lot of any other part of the
army. Nevertheless, these men continued
in a high state of health.</p>

<p>At the period when the plague attacked
the 7th Bombay regiment, they were far
from unhealthy. The prodigious loss of
this corps, which appears in the annexed
table, was at first from the fever which
raged at sea, and subsequently from the
plague, which continued to persecute this
corps from December, when it broke out
among them, till the whole army was
embarked at Suez.</p>

<p>The pioneer-corps was uncommonly
healthy till they came to El Hammed.
Here they had much severe duty. They
were employed in building the hospitals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and very often in cutting the reeds by the
river-side, or in conveying them through
marshes. A very considerable share of
the intermittents that prevailed in the army
was from this corps.</p>

<p>The departments (under which title
are included about five hundred men
employed by the commissaries of cattle,
of provisions, and of stores, and by the
quarter-master general) were, from beginning
to end, more healthy and had
fewer deaths than any one corps in the
army. They lost none but from the
plague; and, when this was discovered,
such precautions were taken that the contagion
was very speedily eradicated. The
extraordinary health of this body of men,
as well as their escape from the plague,
though particularly exposed to the contagion,
I could only attribute to the
commissary of cattle, who had the greater
part of them in his charge. Captain Burr
was constantly among these men, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
most singularly attentive to every thing
that regarded their internal economy.</p>

<p>I am decidedly of opinion, that in the
peculiar soil and climate of Egypt we
are to look for the principal causes of the
diseases which prevailed the most in that
country.</p>

<p>On grounds that appear not slight, we
suspected that several of these diseases
were propagated by contagion. But I
have no intention of entering on the
discussion of the theories of contagion; an
obscure subject, and on which I do not
presume to think that I could throw any
new light. If ever the veil which covers
it be removed, the late discoveries in
chemistry bid fair to do it. The accurate
knowledge which we have acquired of the
composition of bodies, and in particular
of the constituent parts of the atmosphere,
have opened new fields of inquiry to the
philosopher and to the physician. The
successful application of these discoveries to
the practice of physic by the Doctors Beddoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and Thornton, by Dr Rollo, Mr Cruickshank,
Dr Wittman, and other eminent
surgeons of the artillery, and more particularly
by the philanthropic Mr Scott,
of India, deserve the gratitude of the
profession and of mankind at large. Hereafter,
most probably, and when introduced
into general practice, they will be looked
upon as the greatest improvements that
the healing art has received in modern
days.</p>

<p>In respect to the soil and climate of
Egypt, as giving rise to disease, they are
of considerable variety. In a country of
such extent, stretching from the tropic, on
the one side, to the shores of the Mediterranean,
on the other, this might be
expected. If, in Lower Egypt, and on
the bleak shores of the Mediterranean, we
saw the diseases of Europe, and met with
the inflammatory diathesis; in Upper Egypt,
and as we approached the tropic, we met
with the same diseases, and succeeded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the same treatment, as in the peninsula
of India.</p>

<p>Perhaps no country is better known, or
has been oftener described, than Egypt.
I therefore presume that every thing regarding
the climate and soil is generally
known.</p>

<p>Upper Egypt, that is, the cultivated part
of it, is a narrow stripe, laid out sometimes
on one and sometimes on both sides of
the Nile, which, in its course from Abyssinia
till it passes Cairo, is on both sides
enchained with a ridge of mountains.</p>

<p>Lower Egypt is, in general, a fine, rich,
flat, country, interspersed in different places
by branches of the Nile, and overflown
by this river at a particular season; at which
time the country is in the situation of
Holland, or of the fenny counties of England.</p>

<p>The soil in most places is argillaceous
or sandy, and in some calcareous; but
every where there is a strong mixture of
a salt: in most places there are incrustations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of it to some depth. The quality of the
atmosphere, and the proportions of its
different constituent parts, I regret that
I never had an opportunity of ascertaining.</p>

<p>The cultivated part of Egypt, particularly
the Delta, is a very rich country; in
fertility and luxuriance of soil yielding
to none under the face of heaven. The
art of husbandry is there but imperfectly
known; and at their harvests there is a
very great destruction of vegetable matter,
from which hydrogene gas, or hydro-carbonate,
is extricated in great quantities.
Under similar circumstances, in America
as well as in India, I have seen a bad
fever of the intermittent or remittent type
appear. But in Egypt, after the subsiding
of the Nile, which in many places had
covered a great extent of country, there
is a great exhalation from the mud, and
from the putrid animal and vegetable
matters left behind. The effluvia of these
substances, acting on the human body, will
readily account for much disease. If we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
add to these the extreme filth of the
inhabitants of Egypt, their poor diet, their
narrow, close, and ill-ventilated, apartments,
generally much crouded, with the
extreme narrowness of their streets, and
the bad police of their towns, we will not
be astonished if a fever, at first intermittent
or remittent, should have symptoms denominated
malignant, superadded to the
more ordinary symptoms of the disease.
If an imported contagion should make its
appearance at the same time, and under
the above circumstances, we expect a most
terrible disease.</p>

<p>The dry parching wind, which comes
over the desert, and which at certain seasons
blows in Egypt and in Arabia, is well
known, and was often severely felt by the
army on their march, both across the
desert and the isthmus of Suez. The whirlwinds
of sand roll with great impetuosity,
are very troublesome, and insinuate fine
sand and dust every where. It is hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
possible to keep the minute particles out
of the eyes.</p>

<p>The dews, which fall in Egypt, I always
heard were very heavy, and were a cause
of the diseases of the country. I had
occasion too, more than once, to hear the
natives attribute much to them as the cause
of their diseases; with what justice I will
not pretend to decide. From some experiments
which I made in India, on the
Red Sea, and lastly in Egypt, I am inclined
to think that they are equally heavy
in the two former as in the latter quarter.
After weighing it carefully, I
took a piece of lint, twelve inches
square, exposed it for a night to the dew,
and, by weighing it in the morning again,
ascertained the quantity which it had
gained. I am aware that this is by no
means a nice experiment, and that in the
performance of it several particulars demand
attention; but it is sufficient to our purpose,
and I learned by it, that, in the
island of Bombay, on the Red Sea, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in Lower Egypt, the quantity of dew
which falls is nearly equal.</p>

<p>It ought to be mentioned, that, during
the year we were in Egypt, the season
was not the usual one. There was a greater
overflow of the Nile. It rose higher on
the Nilometer than it had done for several
former years, and it was remarked to be
much later in subsiding at Rosetta.</p>

<p>The fall of rain at Alexandria was greater
than on former years; and, at Rosetta,
the rains were in setting in later than usual.
The season of the plague set in much
earlier than usual.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In general, the Thebaid, or Upper
Egypt, is healthier than the Lower. Never
were troops more healthy than the army
when encamped near Ghenné.</p>

<p>Ghiza, the ancient Memphis, at the
time the army disembarked there from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Upper Egypt, we found to be a very
unhealthy quarter. For a considerable
time, and immediately before the arrival
of the Indian army, it had been the station
of large armies: alternately of Turks,
Mamelukes, French, and English. From
all these armies a number died at Ghiza,
and there was much filth and noxious
effluvia. We saw there enough of putrid
animal matter to generate contagion.
Whether this was or was not the cause of
the fever which prevailed, I will not attempt
to decide. One circumstance may
be mentioned. We were here joined by
a detachment of the 86th regiment under
Colonel Lloyd, which, for some months
before, had been doing duty with the
Vizier’s army, which never was healthy.
That the circumstances which existed at
the time of our occupying Ghiza were
the cause of the fever is manifest from
this, that, subsequently to the army going
to the coast, the garrison left in it found
Ghiza a most healthy quarter. The same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
objections are to be made to Rhoda that
are applicable to any marshy situation.</p>

<p>The 86th regiment found Damietta
healthy, till the Turkish troops came
down in great numbers from Cairo; but,
at this period, the British troops were
removed from it.</p>

<p>Rosetta is not a healthy quarter. It is
one of the largest and worst-built towns
in Egypt. There is hardly one street in
it. There are only narrow dirty lanes,
with high houses overhanging each other,
and the passage frequently interrupted by
houses in ruins. It is, on two sides, surrounded
with swamps. The river is in
the front, and behind, it is nearly encompassed
with burying grounds.</p>

<p>The place of the encampment at El
Hammed was an unhealthy spot. About
half a mile in the rear of it there was a
great extent of swampy ground; but there
was no choice: it was necessary to encamp
where there was water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>As a station for the army, Alexandria
had every recommendation. It is built on
a peninsula which formed the antient
harbour, on a fine dry and open situation.
Some squares, and several of its streets, are
open and spacious; very unlike an African
or Asiatic city. Its numerous mosques
afforded us large and airy hospitals and
barracks. In point of health, the inundation
of the water from the lake Maadie
was favourable. It insulated Alexandria;
but the water was in motion, and at such
a distance, that nothing was to be apprehended
from exhalation. All the hospitals
at first were within the walls of the modern
city. The situation of the Pharos is well
known to every one. I have said, that
it was complained of as a quarter for troops,
and with justice. The state of the 61st
regiment shewed this. Subsequently to
their being removed from it, they were
encamped on the outside of the walls.
From this period both the sickness and
mortality in this corps disappeared. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
10th regiment found Fort Triangulaire a
dry, spacious, and airy, barrack. In the
fort they had the means of keeping the
men constantly in their quarters; they were
at some distance from Alexandria, and thus
it was in their power to preserve a regular
internal economy and prevent drunkenness.
When the regiment came to take possession
of this quarter they had a numerous sick-list:
it decreased daily after they came
here; and, finally, the 10th was as healthy
as most other regiments. The barracks of
the 80th regiment, and of the Bengal
volunteer-battalion, were situated close to
Fort Triangulaire; and they possessed all
the same advantages, but that it was not
so easy to confine the men to the barracks.</p>

<p>The barracks of the 88th regiment, at
Fort Cretan, were dry and airy. Though
in a different quarter they possessed nearly
the same advantage as Fort Triangulaire,
with the disadvantages of the quarters of
the 80th regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The horse-artillery and 8th dragoons
were, along with the 26th dragoons, stationed
at Damenhoure, which had every
advantage of a country quarter. It was
situated in a fine, open, cultivated, country.
The station was thought so good, that
at last we sent the sick of the army to
this quarter; and old cases of dysentery
and hepatitis, as well as some of fever,
recovered here with astonishing rapidity.
By the time of their arrival there was in
many a great amendment. They were
conveyed in waggons constructed for them,
and made three days easy journey to
Damenhoure.</p>

<p>In the difference of Upper Egypt in
June, and El Hammed and Rosetta in
December, is included perhaps more than
change of season; there was change of
climate and of heat from 108° to 49° of
the thermometer. We have said that, in
many instances, the causes of disease
at El Hammed could be traced to the
march across the desert and the encampment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
at Rhoda. Very much, however,
was likewise to be attributed to the change
of weather experienced in November and
December.</p>

<p>In every part of the world, with change
of season, some diseases pretty constantly
make their appearance; but in no part
is this so observable as in the countries
under the tropics. In the West-Indian
islands, as well as on the shores of India,
I have repeatedly and uniformly observed
the sick-list of European corps more than
doubled by the third week after the setting
in of the monsoon.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In these countries
a very considerable increase of sick is
likewise found to take place on the change
from the rainy to the dry season. The
change of season in Egypt had nearly an
equal influence on the health of the army
while there.</p>

<p>In a memoir, which, four years ago, I
had occasion to present to the Military and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Medical Boards at Bombay, on the state
of health of the 88th regiment, and of
detachments of the 75th, 77th, 84th, and
86th, regiments, under my care, one
passage is so very closely applicable to
the subject I am now on, that I will extract
it. After pointing out the smaller
proportion of sickness in different corps,
and in proportion as they had been in
India from one, two, three, to twenty, years,
and the very great proportion of disease and
mortality which the European bore to the
native Indian corps, the memoir goes on:</p>

<p>“Though, perhaps, a residence for a
certain length of time, or a naturalisation
to the climate, be necessary, yet one reason
may, with probability, be brought forward
to account for the very great difference,
in point of health, between European and
Indian corps, viz. the great intemperance
of the European in eating and drinking.
A native of India is astonished, at first,
to see the meals of animal food devoured,
and the quantity of spirits drank, by Europeans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
There can be little doubt, that
the nearer we approach to the mode of
living of the natives, the more nearly we
shall attain their state of health.</p>

<p>“On looking over the returns, and observing
the proportional sickness of different
periods, a periodical increase was very
striking. The eight or ten days that
followed the payment of the men, on the
twenty-fourth of every month, regularly
produced much sickness. The soldier’s pay
in India, as in England, and perhaps every
where else, allow him at times to indulge
in excess. He is most amply supplied
with meat and bread, and generally he
has a portion of vegetables; but the allowance
of spirits issued to him is too great.
In the dry season it is a quarter of a pint
daily, and in the rainy months it is double
this quantity. As the price of arrack is
low, the soldier very often procures as
much as he can use; besides which, he
has often access to farrey, or toddey, the
fermented juice of the cocoa-nut tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Some degree of intoxication and intemperance,
in a corps in India, is perhaps
unavoidable. Intemperance has hitherto
always appeared as a principal cause of
the diseases which have prevailed.</p>

<p>“The difference, in point of health,
between the hot and the cold, the dry
and the rainy, months is striking. For
the last eighteen months, in the hot season,
the men had much duty. They were
daily marched two miles to the fort of
Bombay; while there, they were
much exposed to the sun on the garrison-duty;
and, in the heat of the next day,
were marched back to their barracks on the
island of Colabah. Yet it appears, by
the accompanying tables, that the hot
months were the most healthy by far.
If heat be very noxious, something in
this instance obviated its effects. Was this
exercise?</p>

<p>“The first year after the arrival of the
88th regiment, in India, they suffered
considerably. During the month after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that on which the monsoon set in, one hundred
and forty, or more than one fourth
of the corps, were ill of hepatitis or
dysentery. In the second year of the
regiment being in India, only seventy
were admitted into the hospital in the
course of the same month, and this number
was not quite one tenth of the then
strength of the corps. Here, then, we
appear to have gained considerably by
being one year inured to the climate.”</p>

<p>In Egypt I found that all the above-quoted
remarks held good; in particular
that relating to heat. Though the degree
of it be very considerably increased, I
believe that, unless combined with intemperance,
or some other cause, it very
rarely is the exciting cause of disease.
At Kossier, and in crossing the desert,
the degree of heat was very great, and
both the officers and men, from Madras,
as well as Bengal, complained that it was
more insupportable than they had ever
felt it in the hottest seasons. Yet, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
above period, the army enjoyed an uncommon
degree of health, though they necessarily
were much exposed to the sun: but
their minds as well as their bodies were
at this time exercised. Not only on crossing
the desert, but for some time after
we reached the Nile at Ghenné, we all
thought that we were in the neighbourhood
of a division of the French army,
and the Indian army was for some time
kept in the constant hopes of being engaged.</p>

<p>That simple moisture is noxious, the
situation of the 61st regiment, in the
Pharos, shewed; and that moist exhalations
from marshes were active as causes
of the diseases which prevailed, from the
arrival of the army at Rhoda till their
departure from El Hammed, the journal
gives abundant proof.</p>

<p>We received still farther confirmation
of the very great influence which intemperance
has as a cause of disease. We
had demonstration how very little spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
are required, in a hot climate, to enable
the soldier to bear fatigue, and how necessary
a regular diet is.</p>

<p>At Ghenné, and on the voyage down
the Nile, (on account of the difficulty
of at first conveying it across the desert,)
the men had no spirits delivered out to
them; and I am convinced that, from this,
not only did they not suffer, but that it
even contributed to the uncommon degree
of health which they at this time enjoyed.
From two germs, or boats, the soldiers
one day strayed into a village, where the
Arabs gave them as much of the spirit
which they distil from the juice of the
date-tree, as induced a kind of furious
intoxication. It was remarked, that, for
three months after, a considerable number
of these men were in the hospitals.</p>

<p>On the causes of the plague I do not
mean to dwell. I may just mention, that,
after seeing the first cases which occurred
in the Indian army, and attentively studying
the histories of some of the cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
which subsequently appeared, it struck me
that there were many points of resemblance
between this disease and the destructive
fever of the West Indies, which, some
years ago, I saw a good deal of in several of
the islands there. I would by no means,
however, have it implied that I consider
the diseases as the same.</p>

<p>One of our medical gentlemen persevered
in an opinion that the plague was not
contagious. He made the first, and we
sincerely hope the last, experiment of the
kind to determine this question. Dr Whyte
fell a victim to his own temerity.</p>

<p>Never were the effects of fear, in the
treatment of diseases, more felt than at
one period in the Indian army in Egypt.
At the time the plague first broke out,
(as shall be more particularly noticed hereafter,)
the dread of the disease, particularly
among the native troops, was a bar to every
kind of treatment. They exclaimed that
they were sent to the pest-houses merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to die; and some of them refused every
kind of medicine or sustenance.</p>

<p>I shall now advert to some of the
principal measures of prevention of disease
in general: some regulations regarding the
plague are mentioned under the head of
that disease.</p>

<p>Within the last thirty or forty years the
improvements made in the means of preserving
the health of seamen have been
great. These had their rise from the great
Captain Cooke; after him, very much
was done by Dr Lind, of Haslar-hospital;
since, by Dr Blane; and, more lately,
by the present able physician to the fleet,
Dr Trotter.</p>

<p>Under the eminent surgeon-general of
the artillery, a very great deal has been
done in the ordnance-department. Abroad,
as well as at home, their hospitals and the
medical department are in a state not
unworthy of imitation.</p>

<p>Since the time of the Carthagena expedition,
a good deal has been done in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
army likewise. To the present commander-in-chief
the army owes very much; and
the Army Medical Board have, of late,
corrected many abuses, and introduced
much improvement into the medical department:
but much remains to be done
for the soldier, especially when embarked
for service.</p>

<p>Often, during the late war, have we
seen troops suffer much in transports; and,
on one or two occasions, a confinement
of two or three months on ship-board has
crippled regiments, if not armies, and
left them unfit for service.</p>

<p>At no time, I believe, have troops on
any expedition been so long confined on
ship-board as during that of which we
are treating; and in none I believe, not
even in the shortest, has there been a
smaller loss of men.</p>

<p>This is to be ascribed entirely to the
very liberal policy of the great character
at the head of affairs in India, and to
the gallant general selected to command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
on this expedition. It was the governor-general’s
order, that every convenience
and comfort, that might conduce to the
health of the soldier, should be most
amply provided. In consequence of this,
a sufficiency of tonnage, and that calculated
for a warm climate, was procured.
Large, lofty, and roomy, ships were fitted
up, and the greatest care was taken to
embark only such as were in perfect health.
The transports were liberally provided with
every requisite or comfort for a long
voyage: the quality of the water was
particularly attended to. Besides a large
stock of fresh provisions, vegetables of
every kind were shipped. There was a
large stock of potatoes, of onions, bread-fruit,
pickled vegetables, of tea, rice, and
pepper, which were regularly served out
to all. Besides these, for the sick there
was provided a large stock of wines, of
fermented liquors, and of every other
comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>To the very liberal manner in which
the transports were fitted up, and to the
regulations established in every transport
of the fleet, which were rigorously enforced,
is undoubtedly owing the very
healthy state in which most corps remained,
for half a year, on ship-board; and that,
on landing, they were fit to march on
any service.</p>

<p>At Bombay there was, at first, a scarcity
of shipping. One ship sailed thence much
crouded; and, in a three-weeks passage
to Ceylon, those on-board suffered much:
there occurred much sickness and several
deaths. On their arrival at the island of
Ceylon, Mr North immediately ordered
two more vessels for the troops with which
this vessel (the Minerva) was crouded. The
good effects of this measure struck all: thereafter,
during a three-months passage to Kossier,
there died not a man in the Minerva.</p>

<p>The clothing of the Indian army conduced
much, in our opinion, to their
healthiness. They landed with their white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
cotton dresses, which were admirably adapted
to the warm season in which we came
to Egypt; favourable to cleanliness; and,
by consequence, to the exclusion of pestilential
contagion.</p>

<p>From the time of the army first landing
at Kossier, in every situation where it
could be done, bathing was enjoined
throughout the army. In every corps it
was regularly done under the inspection
of a commissioned officer, and any neglect
of cleanliness was most severely punished.
In any country or climate, attention to
cleanliness will be found a principal means
of preserving the health of troops; but,
in Egypt, where contagion was lurking in
every corner, it became indispensably necessary.</p>

<p>In the cold season, and while we were
in Lower Egypt, warm comfortable
clothing and bedding were provided, not
only for every soldier or Sepoy, but likewise
for the women, children, and all the
numerous followers of the army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>The simple diet of the Hindoo is well
suited to a warm climate. It is seldom
more than rice with aromatics, or clarified
butter with a kind of pea, to which the
luxury of a little salt-fish, of preserved
tamarinds, or some fresh fruit, is occasionally
added. As far as it could be done,
the Europeans were made to conform to
this diet; and we are convinced that it
was with much advantage to them. The
light wines of the Greek islands were
issued to the Europeans in the warm season;
but in the cold they got spirits.</p>

<p>In the cold season it was found necessary
to make some change in the diet of the
Sepoys. In the month of January they
suffered so much from the severity of the
weather, and a climate very unlike their
own, that a portion of animal food, as
well as of wine, was ordered to be issued
to them.</p>

<p>The prejudices of country, religion, and
of the different casts of Gentoos, were first
overcome in the Bombay regiments. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
length, the most austere yielded; and,
finally, even the severe Brahmin, as well
as the rigid Mussulman, gave way to the
necessity imposed by their situation in a
foreign country.</p>

<p>The length of time, which most corps
had been in a warm climate, deserves to
be mentioned, as a cause of the health
of the Indian Army in Egypt, till attacked
by the endemic diseases of the
country. No corps in the army had been
less than two years in a warm climate.
During the late war, the value of the
Cape of Good Hope, to us, was often
felt and acknowledged in India. After
being at this healthy settlement and there
seasoned to a warm climate, the 80th, 84th,
and 86th, regiments and the Scotch brigade,
landed in India, in an effective
state, never before witnessed with European
troops in that country. This fact is
not undeserving public consideration.</p>

<p>The fact cannot be too often repeated
or too generally known, that nothing conduces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
more to the health of a corps, than
the preserving a good internal economy
in it. A good commanding officer has,
in general, a healthy regiment. Every
thing can be done in the prevention of
disease; but, unfortunately, very often, little
in the treatment when it supervenes.</p>

<p>One point remains still, and I know no
fitter place to introduce it than here.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned, that liver complaints
rarely recovered in Egypt, and,
likewise, that cases of hepatitis and flux,
which, in India, had long remained obstinate,
here yielded of themselves and without
medicine. This fact leads me to the
suggestion of a measure, which, I conceive,
would save many useful lives. It is, whenever
a case of fever, dysentery, or liver
complaint, in India, is obstinate, or continues
for a long time on the reports, to send
such cases to sea or to Europe.</p>

<p>It is a truth, well known to every medical
man in India, that, after continuing
ill of these disorders a certain time, soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
or sailors never do well there. They linger,
and are, at length, carried off, either
by a suppuration in the liver or ulceration
of the intestines. In India, when patients,
whose situation in life permits them to take
a voyage to Europe, are in this state, they
never fail to take it, and, most commonly,
are recovered by it; but there is no hope
for the poor soldier or sailor there.</p>

<p>The same benefit might, however, be
acquired for the soldier, and with little, or,
perhaps, no, expense: it is not always necessary
that the voyage be a long one, or,
that the change of climate be to Britain.
Were the cruisers of the company or the
king’s ships, from time to time, to take on-board
some of these chronic cases, for one cruise,
the men would be frequently recovered by
it, and, in many cases, they would soon be
capable of doing duty on ship-board, where,
in time of war, Europeans are very much
wanted, but cannot be found in India.
Whenever a voyage in India is not attended
with complete success, a voyage to Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
still offers one chance for life. The prospect
of this, by removing that despondency
which, in chronic diseases is a never-failing
attendant, and which we have too
often found baffle every mode of treatment,
would cheer the patient, and of itself do
infinite good. Men of his Majesty’s regiments
might be brought home, and attached
to the recruiting companies there, whence
able healthy men might be sent in exchange
for them, while the invalid from India
would at the same time recover his health
in a country-quarter at home, and be
equally useful as another man on the recruiting
service.</p>

<p>Humanity, as well as policy, loudly calls
for something to be done. From what I
have seen, I fear that invalids and ineffective
men are sometimes detained by far
too long in India.</p>

<h3>OF THE DISEASES OF THE INDIAN ARMY
IN EGYPT.</h3>

<p>We have now arrived at the last part of
these Sketches; where it is intended to
offer some account of the diseases which
we met with in Egypt.</p>

<p>The catalogue of military diseases is
never extensive. If his peculiar way of
life exposes the soldier more to some
distempers, it entirely exempts him from
many others. In an Indian army the diseases
are even fewer than in any other; at
the same time, that the practice of medicine
is more simple. I am of opinion,
that in India the practitioner goes on surer
ground than in Europe, partly for the
above reason, and partly from the causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of disease being less varied in that country.
Though the diseases which occurred
in the Indian army, when in Egypt, were
not numerous, yet some of them were
highly important, and on our arrival in
Egypt were new to every one of the medical
gentlemen, excepting Mr Bellars,
of the 86th regiment, who had treated a
few cases of the plague, which occurred
in a detachment of that regiment acting
with the Vizier’s army, and had himself
suffered from the ophthalmia of Egypt.</p>

<p>I propose to include every thing that I
have to offer on this part under two heads.
Under the first, I shall notice two diseases
which may be termed the endemics of
Egypt, viz. the plague and the ophthalmia
of that country.</p>

<p>Under the second, the other diseases
which prevailed will be noticed. They are
mostly tropical diseases; and with them the
reader will not be long detained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<h3>OF THE PLAGUE.</h3>

<p>I begin with the plague; a disease of
which accounts have been handed down
to us from the earliest ages of history or
of physic. The consideration of it is important,
not only on account of its frequent
and fatal occurrence, but, as being, perhaps,
the most formidable disease that the
art of physic has to encounter. On this
subject, however, much will not be expected
from me. Of no disease have we a
more clear, accurate, and complete, history
than of this, in Dr Russel’s work on the
plague. In Egypt, we often had recourse
to this work, and we readily acknowledge
our obligations to the venerable and learned
author.</p>

<p>Though since the time that Dr Russel
gave his ample history of the plague in
Syria, we have had several accounts of
this disease as it appeared in other countries;
yet much has not been added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
our stock of information, and little of improvement
has been made in the practice.
The proper and well-timed use of mercury,
and, perhaps still more, the application
of the newly-discovered remedies analogous
in their effects to the calces of that
mineral, hold out a prospect of success
the most encouraging.</p>

<p>In Europe, but more particularly in
Britain, much of the dread, and much of
the real danger, that attended the most
fatal diseases in this country are now done
away, by the late improvements in medicine,
and in chemistry.</p>

<p>The time was, when fever, when it broke
out in different parts of England, proved
little less fatal to whole villages and towns
than the plague does in the countries where
it resides. From the improved practice of
the treatment of fever, but more from
our knowledge of the means of destroying
contagion and preventing its spreading, the
mortality from this class of diseases is now
comparatively small.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The small-pox, that plague which once
carried off so great a proportion of the
population of Europe, now bids fair to be
expunged from the catalogue of diseases.</p>

<p>May we not indulge a hope, that, as
the intercourse of civilized Europe, with
the countries of which the plague is now
the scourge, becomes more regular and
intimate, we may be enabled to extend to
them our discoveries and improvements,
and so direct them to the means of divesting
the plague of its terrors, and reducing
the mortality from it to the scale
of that of fever and the small-pox in Europe?</p>

<p>Egypt has been called the cradle of the
sciences. From this we acknowledge, that
the arts were derived to Greece, and subsequently
to every part of the world. It
would surely be the noblest gratification,
if in return, at this period, Europe, by extending
her benefits and improvements to
Egypt and to Greece, could free them from
the most cruel scourge of countries, once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the most civilized and polished in the
world. It would in some measure compensate
and console them for the low
state of degradation into which they have
fallen.</p>

<p>All that I have to say of the plague
will tend to diminish the dread which has
hitherto been entertained of it.</p>

<p>A formidable disease undoubtedly it is;
but, when we hear how much of the population
of Persia, Arabia, Turkey, Syria,
Egypt, and Barbary, is now and then swept
off, all must not be laid to the account
of the plague, as if its ravages admitted
of no remedy. The experience of the
French and English, in Egypt, will now
convince Europe, that much of the vast
mortality, in the above countries, is to be
ascribed to the gross ignorance in which
they are immersed.</p>

<p>Were typhus, our jail or hospital fever,
to be imported into a town of Egypt, we
can hardly conceive how it could ever be
eradicated by the natives. Whenever the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
small-pox does appear in that country, it
proves a dreadfully-destructive disease.
The structure of their houses and plans of
their streets are calculated for the production
of disease, and the preservation and
concentration of contagion.</p>

<p>It is a matter of no little consolation to
us, that we know the means, not only of
excluding the plague from our own country,
but that, when our armies are stationed
in the countries where the disease is
endemic, we can arrest the progress of
the contagion, and with certainty eradicate
it.</p>

<p>The plague made its first appearance, in
the army from India, in the middle of
September, 1801. From its early appearance
the natives were very much alarmed,
and prophesied a dreadful season of plague.
They have observed, that, when it breaks
out before December, they have always a
generally-prevailing and a very destructive
disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The number of cases which appeared
in the Indian army, from the 15th of
September, 1801, to the 15th of June,
1802, is seen in an accompanying table.</p>

<p>After the plague broke out, the disease
was for a long time confined to Rosetta;
it was otherwise in the former season.</p>

<p>Soon after the British army effected their
landing at Aboukir, in March, 1801, they
were attacked with the plague, though the
season was then on the decline. In the
beginning of the year, the disease had
prevailed very generally over the whole
country, and the loss arising from thence, to
the French, was considerable. It continued
to spread in the British army till May, during
which month few cases appeared; but
none I believe in June.</p>

<p>Though the contagion is seldom or never,
I believe, out of the country, the natives
of Egypt denominate the season of plague
from November or December of one year,
to June of the year following; they observe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
that the disease constantly stops at
the period of the summer solstice.</p>

<p>I have said, that, during the season ending
in June, 1801, the disease prevailed
very generally in Egypt; Rosetta, however,
was an exception; if any case did occur
there it was concealed.</p>

<p>At Cairo, Alexandria, and Damietta; at
Suez, in the villages, and in Upper Egypt;
it proved very fatal: at Siout, at Girgé,
and in general throughout the towns and
villages in Upper Egypt, we saw continued
marks of its desolation, and heard many
dismal accounts of its ravages.</p>

<p>The reason of the plague first appearing
in, and afterwards being confined only
to, Rosetta, in the last season, was, that it
was the only open port to which vessels from
Turkey and Greece resorted; and that
from some of these, no doubt, the disease
was imported.</p>

<p>In the pest-houses of the army, thirteen
medical gentlemen did duty, who in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Indian army might be said to have had the
post of honour. They were, Mr Thomas,
Mr Price, Mr Rice, Dr Whyte, Mr Grysadale,
Mr Adrian, Mr O’Farrel, Mr Whyte,
Mr Dyson, Mr Angle, Mr Moss, Dr Buchan,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and Dr Henderson. Besides these,
Mr Cloran was in charge of the cases
under observation, and Mr Bell of cases
under quarantine. Mr Blackwell, surgeon
on the staff of the English army, acted
as inspecting surgeon to the Board of
Health. He visited every case in the first
instance, and, as he judged it necessary,
sent them to the quarantine, to the observation-ground,
or to the pest-house: to
Mr Blackwell’s unceasing attention and discriminating
knowledge of the pestilential
symptoms, we owed no small share of our
safety in Alexandria.</p>

<p>Besides the above gentlemen, we had
two Greeks, the barber-doctors usually employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in Egypt, who visited the inhabitants,
and before interment narrowly examined
every body. These two made a
daily report to the Board of Health of
the number of deaths and of their inspection
of the bodies; they likewise did
other duties under Mr Blackwell.</p>

<p>In order to take from our medical
gentlemen, in the pest-houses, some of the
most dangerous part of the duty, it was
my wish to procure some of the Greek
doctors of the country to reside in the
pest-houses, to feel the pulses there, draw
blood, open and dress buboes, &amp;c. The
most diligent search was made for those
people, and very high pay was promised
to them, but we could tempt none of them
to live in our pest-houses: a plain proof
of the opinion which they entertain of
the contagious nature of the disease.</p>

<p>The thirteen gentlemen first mentioned,
were those only that were directly in the
way of contagion, for, it became their
duty to come into contact with the infected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and seven of them caught the infection,
and four died.</p>

<p>To the atmosphere of the disease all the
medical gentlemen of the army were exposed,
as they saw and examined the cases
in the first instance; but, except from
actual contact, there never appeared to be
any danger.</p>

<p>The sketch which I mean to give of
the plague, I draw principally from the
reports made to me by the surgeons of
the army, and from a pretty voluminous
correspondence with the gentlemen whose
names have been already mentioned. From
my own experience I hardly can venture
to speak: it was very limited. Though I
saw a great many cases, in the first stage
of the disease, the number of cases which
I treated throughout was very small; they
were the cases which first appeared in
the army, and my success in them leaves
me little to boast of.</p>

<p>The reports and statements of the different
gentlemen I have compared together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and endeavoured to reconcile them by
what I myself saw of many of the cases.</p>

<p>I have generally given the names of
the gentlemen by whom the different
facts are related: I have always done this
where the reports of two gentlemen disagreed.</p>

<p>From the sources of which I am possessed,
I think I can bring forward some
new facts regarding the disease, particularly
in the treatment. It is much to be
regretted, that no traveller, acquainted with
the modern practice with mercury and
the analogous remedies, ever resided in
the countries where this disease is endemic.</p>

<p>In one circumstance, there is a very
generally-prevailing opinion in regard to
the plague, viz. that extremes of both heat
and cold stop the progress of the contagion.</p>

<p>If this be true, in regard to heat, it did
not appear to be so in the army in Egypt
in regard to cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The period at which the plague raged
the most was in the coldest months.</p>

<p>It would appear, that, in different countries
and in different seasons in the same
countries, the plague assumes very different
appearances. The plague is seen as
varied in its appearance as the different
fevers described by Sydenham to prevail
in different years, and under different
constitutions of the air, in England.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of this fact enables us
to reconcile the different or opposite accounts
given of the disease, and of its
treatment by different writers.</p>

<p>In the Indian army, when the disease
first broke out, the cases sent from the
crowded hospitals of the 61st and 88th
regiments, were from the commencement
attended with the typhoid or low symptoms.</p>

<p>The cases sent from the Bengal volunteer
battalion, and from the other corps,
when the army was encamped near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
marshy ground at El Hammed, were all
of the intermittent or remittent type.</p>

<p>The cases which occurred, in the cold
rainy months of December and January,
had much of the inflammatory diathesis.
Mr A. Whyte remarked, that every case
admitted into the hospital, at Rahamania,
had the symptoms of pneumonia.</p>

<p>In the end of the season, at Cairo,
Ghiza, Boulac, and on crossing the isthmus
of Suez, the disease wore the form of a
mild continued fever.</p>

<p>The resemblance which some cases
shewn and of others described to me bore
to the West-Indian fever struck me very
forcibly.</p>

<p>I know not that I can better describe
the disease, than by a short statement of
the cases of some of the medical gentlemen
who had the disease; most of whom
wrote me accurately every thing that they
felt. Dr Whyte entered the pest-house at
El Hammed on the evening of the 2d of
January, 1802. In a letter of that date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
he writes to me, “I just now inoculated
myself, by friction, with bubonic matter
on the left thigh;” on the 3d, he says, “I
have this morning inoculated myself by
incision on the right fore-arm.” Mr Rice,
then doing duty in the pest-house at El
Hammed, gives the whole of the case. In
a letter on the 3d of January, he writes
to me, “Dr Whyte came here last night;
soon after he came in, he rubbed some
matter from the bubo of a woman on the
inside of his thighs. The next morning,
he inoculated himself in the wrist with a
lancet, with matter taken from the running
bubo of a Sepoy; he appears now
very well.”</p>

<p>In subsequent letters, Mr Rice says,
“that Dr Whyte continued in good health
on the 5th, and all day on the 6th, till
the evening, when he was attacked with
rigors and other febrile symptoms. He said
himself that it was the attack of an intermittent;
and it bore a great resemblance
to it. After sweating profusely, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
better in the morning of the 7th, but in
the afternoon the shivering returned; and,
after it had continued 30 minutes, a severe
hot stage came on, then a profuse sweating
followed, but with it much affection
of the head, tremor of the limbs, particularly
of the upper extremities, tongue
black and dry, skin hot, pulse full, hard,
and irregular, thirst great, prostration of
strength, and anxiety. The head was the
only place that he complained of, and it
seemed to be the principal seat of his disease;
he still persisted that the disease was
not the plague; he would not allow his
groin or arm-pits to be examined, and he
refused all medical assistance.” He asked
for a purgative, which Mr Rice gave him,
and he requested to be bled, this Mr
Rice thought the state of the symptoms
would not justify him in doing. On the
8th, these symptoms continued, and there
was some delirium; he begged to be removed
from the pest-house at El Hammed,
to the old pest-house at Rosetta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
under the charge of Arabs. He was removed
on the morning of the 9th, and
died in the afternoon of that day very
delirious.</p>

<p>2d, Mr Price did duty in the pest-house
at Rosetta and at El Hammed from
the beginning of November, 1801, and
had a tertian which he never could completely
remove. In the pest-house at El
Hammed, he was in the evening of the
1st of January attacked with rigors and
slight febrile symptoms; but he himself
thought this was only an attack of his
intermittent, he soon however felt an affection
of his head, and tremor of his
limbs, and knew his disease. On the
morning of the 2d, three buboes appeared,
two femoral and one axillary; he
then became delirious, and had no recollection
of any thing for several days. On
the 5th, there was a remission of the fever.
He was able, on the 7th, to write
me, “that he had no fever, that one
bubo was coming on, and that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
extremely debilitated.” On the 13th Mr
Rice opened his bubo; but it was two
months after this before he recovered.</p>

<p>I am sorry I cannot find a letter where
the treatment of Mr Price is detailed; but
I am pretty clear that it was by mercury,
as this was his own practice at the
time.</p>

<p>3d, Mr O’Farrel entered the pest-house
at Aboukir on the 8th of March. He
continued well and did his duty there
till the 3d of April; in the evening of that
day, when he had rigors, which he himself
attributed to cold, and says, “that sudorifics
nearly cured him.” He was obstinately
costive, for which he took several drastic
purgatives: the rigors successively returned
in the evenings of the 5th and 6th, and
he continued taking antimonial powder.
On the night of the 6th, he was attacked
with giddiness, irritability of stomach, and
low fever. Mr Dyson wrote to me, that, on
the morning of the 6th, he was delirious,
that he had applied a blister to his head;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
but that he could not get him to swallow
any medicine: he expired on the morning
of the 7th. No bubo appeared till
the day before his death.</p>

<p>4th, Mr Dyson went to assist Mr O’Farrel,
at Aboukir, on the 1st of April. On the
evening, of the 5th, he was attacked with
lassitude, and, on feeling his groin, he
writes to me, “I discovered some inflammation
of the glands.” After this the
succession of symptoms in Mr Dyson was
nearly what has been described in Dr
Whyte’s case. The fever continued for
several days, and became intermittent, one
bubo came to suppuration. He obstinately
refused every medicine but calomel, which
he took as a purgative, but it never salivated
him. Constant nausea and vomiting
were symptoms with him from the
second day of his illness, and he was a
long time before he recovered.</p>

<p>5th, Mr Thomas, after being three weeks
in the pest-house at Rosetta, attending the
first plague-cases which came from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
88th regiment, while walking in the garden
of the establishment, laid his hand on his
groin by accident, and was alarmed to find
a large swelling on one side. He soon
after felt some giddiness and fell down;
as soon as he recovered, he rubbed in
mercurial ointment in great quantity, and
every hour took as much calomel with
opium as his stomach could bear. His
gums were very quickly affected, his bubo
came to suppuration, and, in three weeks,
he was quite well.</p>

<p>6th, Mr Angle, after being about a month
in the lazaretto at Alexandria, was attacked
with fever and bubo. The bubo never
could be brought forward, and he died of
the disease on the 14th day. I have no
notes of the treatment of this case nor
that of Mr Moss; who, after having been
about the same time on duty at the lazaretto
of Alexandria, caught the infection.
He likewise lived several days, and his
bubo could never be brought forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>It is useless to detail more cases, though
I am in possession of many accurately
related by several gentlemen. Nor do I
mean to offer any comment on the
above.</p>

<p>As particularly prominent and remarkable,
I cannot, however, without some notice,
pass over three cases where mercury,
early and liberally exhibited, had very remarkable
effects.</p>

<p>I received several accounts of the good
effects of mercury from the gentlemen in
the pest-houses, but none so remarkable
as the following:—In the beginning of
the season, on the breaking out of the
disease in the crowded hospital of the
88th regiment; every man in the hospital
was examined at different periods of the
day, and thus the disease was detected on
its very first appearance. At this time, I
gave to each of three of the men, placed
in the observation-ward of the hospital,
(of whom Littlejohn and Egan have already
been mentioned,) two grains of calomel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and the sixth of a grain of opium
every hour, and made them rub into the
inside of the legs, thighs, arms, and neck,
half an ounce of the strong mercurial
ointment three times a day. I, at the
same time, made them take each half
an ounce of nitric acid diluted in their
drink during the day, and put their feet
and hands, three times during the day,
into a strong nitric bath. In about twenty-four
hours, their mouths became severely
affected, a tenderness in their arm-pits and
groins went off, and the severest febrile
symptoms yielded. The men were, however,
extremely debilitated, and remained a
very long time convalescent. During their
convalescence, I thought it prudent to
keep them in quarantine, being fully convinced,
that they had had an attack of
the plague, the progress of which had been
arrested, and the disease cut short by the
above treatment.</p>

<p>Corporal Francis, as already mentioned,
was suddenly attacked with giddiness after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
coming off from duty as corporal of the
guard in the pest-house. In the very
commencement of the disease, on the first
feeling of illness, he was brought to Mr
Price, who instantly admitted him and immediately
exhibited mercury, and as soon
as the gums became affected, the febrile
symptoms vanished. He remained some
time in the hospital, on account of a bubo,
which came to suppuration; but
Francis suffered very little. He was never
more than two days confined to bed,
though the case occurred at a time when
the disease was very violent.</p>

<p>The case of Peter the interpreter strongly
evinces the success of the mercurial
treatment. To this case, the mercurial
pills and ointment were given; and he was,
in every respect, treated as a case of syphilis
and was speedily cured.</p>

<p>In the cases related, there appeared some
facts as to the time the matter of the pestilential
contagion takes before it comes into
action. Other facts shew, that, in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
people, and under different circumstances,
there is the greatest variety in this. The
lazaretto at Alexandria was infected by the
admission of an Italian merchant, and the
guard there, consisting of 14 men, caught
the disease, but were attacked on different
days. The provost’s guard and his prisoners
at Alexandria caught the infection from a
deserter confined among them, and the
disease among these people appeared at
very different periods.</p>

<p>Mr Rice relates two cases on this part
of the subject, which appear worthy of
detail: he says, “we have had proofs, that
the pestilential virus remains a considerable
time in the habit, without exerting
its influence or shewing its virulence. A
striking case occurred lately: a Sepoy
was sent to the pest-house from the hospital
of the 7th regiment with plague;
his wife could not be prevented from accompanying
him, where she attended and
nursed him. The Sepoy died, and the
woman was ordered into quarantine; however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
she escaped, and after some days
search she was discovered near the regimental
hospital of the 7th. As this woman
had the greatest reluctance to going
to quarantine, a centinel was put over her
in the hut where she was, and all communication
with her was stopped: she continued
in good health till the tenth day
after her escape from the pest-house; in
the afternoon of this day, she was attacked
with fever, in a few hours after, the
inguinal glands became painful, and she
was carried to the pest-house at El Hammed.”</p>

<p>“Another case bore a great affinity to
the above: a Sepoy came into the pest-house
to attend his wife: the man was
sent into quarantine, and he continued
well there, till the seventeenth day, on
which plague-symptoms appeared, and he
was sent to the pest-house.”</p>

<p>Of the symptoms of the plague, fever,
though not always present, seemed the
most constant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the season, at Cairo, at
Ghiza, and at Suez, cases appeared without
any observable fever. When it did
appear, as already noticed, the type at
different seasons, and in different parts of
Egypt, was very various. At the pest-house
at Rosetta and El Hammed, many of the
cases, admitted from October to January,
had the accompanying fever intermittent
and of the quotidian type. This I believe
to be a new fact in the history of the
disease. For some time in January, February,
and in some part of March, the fever
had regular remissions. After this
period, it generally appeared of the typhus
form at Aboukir, except in the detachment
of the 26th Light Dragoons, all of
whom were young healthy men, and in
them Mr O’Farrel observed, “that there
was much re-action, and that the delirium
was of the kind denominated phrenitis.”</p>

<p>At the pest-house, at Rahaminia, Mr
Whyte observed, that all his patients had
pluritic complaints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The second symptom in order was the
tremor of the limbs. Mr Price says, “that
bubo and pyrexia are not so essential
parts of the diagnosis, as tremor of the
upper extremities,” and</p>

<p>3dly, The affection of the head, which
was sometimes phrenitis, and sometimes
typhomania. In a great majority of Mr
Price’s, Mr Rice’s, and Mr Whyte’s, cases
there was much nervous affection; in one,
the risus sardonicus. Mr Adrian says, the
nervous affection, in many cases, was very
remarkable; in several cases, it resembled
the description, given by authors, of that
nervous affection produced by the bites of
mad or poisonous animals, an almost universal
tremor.</p>

<p>4thly, The glandular affection was the
next most generally attending symptom.
Not above one-half of Mr Whyte’s cases
had buboes; and, in a great majority of
Mr Rice’s patients, this symptom did not
appear. Dr Henderson says, that, in every
one of his cases, there was either inflammation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
or swelling of the glands. The glands
most commonly affected were the femoral,
next the axillary, then the parotid, submaxillary,
&amp;c. In one case of Mr Adrian, an abscess,
of the size of a pigeon’s egg, formed
on the inner canthus of the left eye. Mr
Adrian opened it by incision, and the patient
did well. Many were surprised at the
rapidity with which the appearance of
bubo followed the first complaint of illness:
in a number of cases, within four
hours. Mr Rice, on the 7th of January, admitted
five cases, and in none of them
were buboes later of appearing than six
hours after the first feeling of illness. In
a Sepoy of the 7th regiment, taken ill in
December, the femoral axillary, parotid,
submaxillary, and sublingual, glands were
all affected. In another Sepoy of the same
regiment, admitted by Mr Rice, a case of
re-infection, so very much swelled were
the glands about the neck, that the man
died of suffocation the day on which he
was admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>5thly. The next most generally-attending
symptom was the affection of the
abdomen. Mr Price says, the hepatic region
was in every instance affected. Sometimes
there was a swelling of the region
of the liver, pain was experienced from
pressure, sometimes in the epigastric, sometimes
in the hypogastric, region; and almost
always in the region of the liver,
at which time, the pain has in some
cases extended to the kidneys. Swelling
of the belly was very frequent; in some
cases the abdomen appeared a mass of
knots. Uneasiness at the precordia, nausea,
and vomiting, were frequent: the vomiting
was always of bile, which was of different
colours in different stages of the disease.
Mr Price writes, “costiveness was a constant
and obstinate symptom; and, when
ten or twelve grains of calomel brought
fæces down, they were always accompanied
with bile; first brown, then yellow.”
The urine was in general yellow; the
skin and adnata frequently of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
colour. Mr O’Farrel says, “I lost one of
the dragoons from the affection of his
side; the fever went off some days before
his death.” Mr Adrian writes, “I do
not find the constipation an universal
symptom, although, in many cases, I have
met with it very obstinate. I was once
obliged to give eighteen grains of calomel
and two scruples of cathartic extract before
my patient was moved.” In several cases,
the disease commenced with diarrhœa or
dysentery. Some of Mr Thomas’s patients
died of dysentery; and this might have been
said to be the cause of their death, as they
recovered from the bubo, fever, and other
symptoms of plague.</p>

<p>6thly. In the first part of the season,
petechiæ, vibices, maculæ, and carbuncles,
were not seen: in the middle of the season
they frequently appeared.</p>

<p>7thly. Some gentlemen could distinguish
the disease by a particular look of horror
and by a particular cast of the eye, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
was first watery, next blood-shot, and at
last yellow.</p>

<p>8thly, According to the diversity of the
season, the pulse varied. In general, it
was small and frequent, and often, when
at the wrist it was not perceptible, it
could be felt beating 130 or 140 at the
carotids.</p>

<p>9thly, The tongue was universally white
at the edges; and, when in March and
April, some cases appeared with the fever
of the typhoid form, it was black and
furred in the centre.</p>

<p>10thly, Several of the cases, which came
under Mr Grisdale’s care in February and
March, had cough and dyspnœa. Mr
Adrian makes a similar report at the above
period, and three of Mr Whyte’s patients
at Rahamania had cough and dyspnœa.</p>

<p>11thly, In a majority of Mr Price’s cases,
he remarked an unusual dryness of the skin,
and that it was with the utmost difficulty
that he could ever excite perspiration. Mr
Whyte says, that, “At Rahamania the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
was dry, and that he had never succeeded
in exciting sweating.”</p>

<p>These are the appearances the disease
put on in the last season; and, on inquiry,
I find that they were the appearances it
assumed in the former season in the British
army in Egypt.</p>

<p>My friend, Dr Short, who resided some
time in Persia, and who has paid much
attention to the history of the plague, informed
me, that, in addition to the above,
he found hemorrhage a frequent symptom
in the plague, which raged at Bagdad in
1800 and 1801.</p>

<p>In one case he saw a copious hemorrhage
from the eyes, which continued for
nearly twelve hours. As soon as it stopped,
an eruption appeared over the body
very much resembling the measles. This
patient, a boy of twelve years old, died on
the 5th day of the disease.</p>

<p>The duration of the disease in different
persons was very different. In several instances,
the effect of the pestilential contagion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
was the immediate extinction of
life; and we had several instances of the
patient surviving but a few hours the first
sensation of illness.</p>

<p>The muccadum of the dooley-bearers
of the 88th regiment, about nine in the
morning, exhibited the symptoms of fever.
About twelve, a bubo appeared, and
he died before four o’clock. In some
instances, again, the patient lived till the
thirteenth and seventeenth day of the
disease; however, these instances were
rare.</p>

<p>Prognosis. We found that the greatest
caution was requisite in giving an opinion
as to the probable event of cases: in no
disease was the practitioner oftener deceived.
In several instances, patients who
had recovered from the fever, whose buboes
were doing well, and people who
were convalescent, suddenly dropped down
and expired. Whether this was from re-infection,
or whether it was a feature of the
disease; will be difficult to determine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 24th of December, one of the
Arab servants, convalescent from the disease,
and who had been convalescent for eight
days, taking bark, while smoking his pipe
suddenly expired. In no disease do patients
bear motion worse than in this.
The least motion<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> induced syncope or
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, they who had for some time
been convalescent, suddenly complained that
they felt giddy, and expired. Sometimes
they called for food, and expired with it
in their mouths. In one of Mr Adrian’s
cases, where the fever had for some time
been gone, and the patient was so far
convalescent that he daily walked about
a quarter of a mile, the man suddenly
complained of giddiness, and expired in
ten minutes.</p>

<p>Mr Thomas had two cases where, after
affecting their gums, there was a complete
apyrexia: but he lost his patients from an
immense discharge from the glands and
from a secondary fever. In general, it
was found, that the patient recovered in
proportion to the facility with which his
gums and skin could be affected.</p>

<p>The <i>prognosis</i> likewise depended much
on the degree of the affection of the sensorium;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
when the patient was from the
beginning comatose, the case terminated
fatally. Several of the cases in the beginning
of the season, particularly the natives
of India, could never be roused. The typhomania
was a more fatal delirium than
the inflammatory species.</p>

<p>In the <i>treatment</i> of this disease, a variety
of modes were put in practice; but
so little success attended them, that some
were inclined to despair of success from
any. Though, with it, even many were
lost, yet oxygenation and particularly the
use of mercury had the most success.</p>

<p>Though every thing was done by General
Baird that the situation and circumstances
allowed, yet the gentlemen in the
pest-houses laboured under so many disadvantages,
that, for the most part, there was
but little to be expected from any mode
of treatment. In particular, not a little
difficulty, as well as danger, was met with
in affecting the gums. Safety required that
the pest-houses should be at some distance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
perhaps, in general, the distance at which
they were placed was too great. The patient
suffered much by the conveyance,
and frequently the treatment of the disease
was entered on at too late a period
to promise success. In December, January,
February, and March, patients suffered so
much from the extreme severity of the
weather, that in some instances it was not
easy to determine whether a patient died
from cold or from the plague.</p>

<p>So much dejection prevailed among the
natives of India, that, from the moment of
the attack, they gave themselves up, and
said they were sent to the pest-house to
die. They never could be prevailed upon
to swallow a morsel of food nor any
medicine, and some actually starved themselves.</p>

<p>With establishments of a proper structure,
and under proper regulations, we may
safely venture to affirm, that our loss from
the plague in Egypt would not have been
half of what it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>In the treatment of this disease, the
first indication was, to clear the primæ
viæ. Some gentlemen exhibited emetics;
but in general there was no time for this.
The general practice at last was, to begin
by giving a purge of calomel, and the
general remark was, that, if it operated
briskly, the head was relieved and the
skin became soft.</p>

<p>The second indication most generally
agreed upon, was the inducing ptyalism and
perspiration. As offering the fairest prospect
of effecting both at once, Mr Price
proposed using the warm nitric-acid bath,
but unfortunately our stock of nitric-acid
was insufficient to do this, otherwise than
on a small scale. Mr Price got a little
of the acid at El Hammed; but, from
circumstances there, he could not always
have the warm bath; however, he writes,
“On three of my patients, whose gums
I could not readily affect with mercury,
I determined to try the nitric-acid bath:
it has shewn wonderful effects, ptyalism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
has been produced in all the three; but
the cold has regularly induced rigors and
severe attacks of fever, and I shall loose
my patients.”</p>

<p>Nitric acid was given internally; and,
where the patients would drink it, it shewed
good effects. Mr O’Farrel, at Aboukir,
succeeded in making three dragoons take
it much diluted as their common drink;
and they did well all of them.</p>

<p>Mr Price thought well of citric acid. In
some of the Arabs he effected cures by
this, and by a bath of strong vinegar.</p>

<p>Both Mr Rice and Mr Price were in the
habit of washing their patients with vinegar
and sponging them with it, as strong
as it could be procured, or with lime-juice.
They dipped rags in the acids, and
kept them constantly applied to the buboes.
The head and stomach were relieved by
wet cloths being kept to the scrotum.</p>

<p>The third indication was, to obviate the
debility which appeared always to be very
great. With this view, bark, wine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
opium, were very largely given; and, at a
certain stage, the cold bath.</p>

<p>At first, calomel was used only as a
purgative, but, at last, the use of this remedy
was carried farther. The reports
were, “that, upon the mouth becoming
sore, the skin became softer, the pulse
more regular, the eye more clear, the
tongue more moist, and that the thirst with
the affection of the head and of the abdomen
entirely disappeared. The evacuations
too were copious, and approached
more nearly to their natural colour.”
Mr Price writes, “So much am I persuaded,
that in the modes of oxygenation,
I am in possession of an infallible remedy,
that now I purposely expose myself.”
Where he succeeded in affecting the gums,
Mr Thomas lost none of his patients, and
Mr Price in a late letter says, “Calomel
affected the gums of all my patients who
survived.” It was a general remark, that
the gums were remarkably obstinate and
insensible to the effects of mercury in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
this disease. Mr Grisdale writes, “in two
of the cases, I for five days pushed calomel
and mercurial ointment to a very
great length, but never could succeed in
affecting the gums.” Both these patients,
in a subsequent letter, he reports to have
died. Here a particular fact deserves to
be noticed: one of the medical gentlemen,
who went on duty into the pest-house,
and escaped the disease, on account of
an old venereal complaint, used mercury
and nitric acid very freely during the two
months of his tour of duty, and he was
one of the six who escaped the infection.
On the whole, in mercury and the nitric
acid, we appear to have excellent remedies
for the plague: but they must be
very early and very liberally exhibited. If
the first stage is allowed to pass over before
they are given, the season of doing
it with advantage is in danger of being
lost. When the stomach becomes irritable,
I suspect that they never can be given
with propriety. Perhaps, of all the cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
which occurred in the army, this treatment
never got a fair chance of success,
excepting in those which occurred on the
first breaking out of the disease in the hospital
of the 88th regiment, in Mr Thomas’s
case, and in that of Corporal Francis.</p>

<p>I regret, that, in this disease, we did
not give a full and more fair trial to cold
bathing. The extraordinary circumstance
of the escape of the Lascar from the Rosetta
pest-house, and the great benefit which
I have seen from it in the yellow-fever,
to which the plague bears no slight resemblance,
would induce me to give it a
full trial in plague.</p>

<p>I have, I believe, recounted the principal
part of the treatment, and that which
was most generally agreed upon. Other
modes received a trial; but, from an experience
of their inefficacy they were all
deserted.</p>

<p>Dr Whyte used the lancet very freely, but
every one of his patients died; Dr Buchan
was in the habit occasionally of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
recourse to it; and, in the first season, he
said, that he had met with several cases
where bleeding was of the greatest service.
In the beginning of the season, Mr Price
bled one patient. The blood appeared very
dark, and dissolved: this patient died, and
Mr Price never repeated the operation on
any other.</p>

<p>Some gentlemen, attached to the Brunonian
system, put the stimulating plan to
the test. By Messieurs Adrian and Whyte,
patients were for some time kept under
the influence of wine and opium; but,
this practice was never successful and they
deserted it. It was at length the practice
of Mr Adrian to unite stimulants and mercurials.</p>

<p>Seldom before, I believe, have the bodies
of those who died of this disease been
dissected. The first was a Sepoy, by Mr
Price alone; the second by Messieurs
Price and Rice; and, in the last subject,
viz. Signior Posetti, the Italian merchant,
so severely affected were both of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
gentlemen, that it put a stop to this mode
of investigation. The general appearances
seen on the subjects, were, a perfectly-diseased
state of the glandular system.
In the liver, no matter was found; but,
it was much enlarged and greatly diseased.
Signior Posetti had only one bubo; the femoral
gland was sixteen times the natural
size and weight; and the blood, from the
femoral artery, flowed black, pitchy, and
dissolved in its texture. I come now to
the last, and most pleasing part of the
subject, the means of</p>

<p><i>The prevention.</i> If, in the treatment of
the disease, we were not successful, we
assuredly were completely so in the prevention.
At length, this became so generally
known, that we no longer heard the
distressing accounts of despondence and
despair among the natives. They now no
longer entertained such a dread of the
pest-houses. We at length even found volunteers
from the natives for duty in the
pest-houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>There was hardly a corps, or an hospital
in the army, where, at one period
or other, the disease did not make its appearance,
but it was always in our power
to arrest its progress. In well regulated
corps, where a rigid discipline was enforced,
and proper attention to the interior
economy was paid, it rarely happened, indeed,
that much difficulty was experienced
in eradicating the contagion.</p>

<p>As our success in the prevention was
so great, all that remains for me is to
mention the substance of General Baird’s
order to the army on this subject.</p>

<p>1st, To every hospital, an observation-room,
or in lieu of it a tent was attached,
and to it, every case whatever with febrile
symptoms was sent, as soon as discovered,
and was there most strictly watched
by the surgeon.</p>

<p>2dly, On any symptoms of the plague
appearing, the case was instantly sent to
the pest-house from the observation-room
of the regimental hospital: the patient was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
accompanied by the medical gentlemen
of his corps who attended him, and who
gave the medical gentlemen at the pest-house
an account of the previous treatment
of the case.</p>

<p>If any doubt remained, the patient in
the first instance was placed in the observation-room
of the pest-house; and, if the
disease did not turn out to be plague, he
was sent to the quarantine.</p>

<p>3dly, In every corps, and in every department,
a minute inspection by the surgeon
was made twice a week; and every
person with the smallest appearance of ill-health
was sent to the hospital.</p>

<p>4thly, Every corps or hospital, where
a case of plague had appeared, was put
into a state of quarantine; and, in such
corps or hospital, an inspection by the
surgeons was made at least two or three
times a day; and every case with suspicious
symptoms was ordered to the observation-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>5thly, In suspected corps, it was ordered,
that, under the inspection of a commissioned
officer, every person should be bathed more
frequently, and at stated periods; and, likewise,
that all their clothing and bedding
should be frequently washed and baked.
To all the hospitals, ovens and smoking-rooms
were attached.</p>

<p>6thly, Quarters of corps, hospitals, and
ground of encampments, were frequently
changed.</p>

<p>7thly, Much is to be attributed to the
nitrous fumigation. In several instances
it was attended with the best effects. The
lamps, with this, were kept constantly burning
in the observation-rooms, and in the
rooms from which the cases of the plague
had come. Vessels, with the materials for
the fumigation, were likewise placed under
the beds, and in the corners of the rooms.
When our stock of nitric was at length
exhausted, we substituted marine salt for it;
but this fumigation could not be kept up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in rooms were the patients were all confined
to their beds.</p>

<h3>OF THE OPHTHALMIA
OF EGYPT.</h3>

<p>The other endemic, and next to the
plague in importance, is the ophthalmia
of Egypt; which, though a less fatal, is
a more distressing, malady.</p>

<p>In Egypt, at particular seasons, it is a
most generally-prevailing disease. It is not
confined to the human race; the animals
of the country, particularly the dogs and
camels, are subject to its attacks. Travellers
(and, if I remember, Volney is one)
describe the same disease as prevailing in
Syria; and, I am informed, by my friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Dr Short, that, in Persia, ophthalmia is a
most frequent and severe disease.</p>

<p>In Egypt this disease proved most distressing
and obstinate. The French, it was
said, sent from Egypt to France 1000 blind
men.</p>

<p>The number sent home from the English
army was very considerable likewise. Of
the Indian army, 50 were sent home invalids
from blindness; most of whom were
from the 10th and 88th regiments.</p>

<p>Ophthalmia prevailed most in the 61st
regiment; after them, in the 86th regiment:
while the 8th dragoons, the artillery, and
the 80th regiment, had very little of the
disease.</p>

<p>It was remarked, at all times, that the
disease was seen much less frequently, and
with less violence, in the native Indian,
than in the European, corps. Of the former,
the 1st Bombay regiment had much
more ophthalmia than any other corps of
natives. It was said, that, in the English
army, the disease prevailed most in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
dragoon-regiments. The 26th dragoons
was mentioned as a particular instance of
this: that corps alone, I heard, sent home
about 40 invalids from ophthalmia.</p>

<p>Several gentlemen thought that this disease,
in Egypt, was contagious.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> So singular
an opinion I would hesitate to offer
on slender grounds. However, the remarkable
prevalence of the disease in particular
regiments, and even in particular companies
of regiments, while the same general causes
prevailed every where, will not be easily
accounted for, without admitting something
of the kind. In some corps of the
army from England, as well as that from
India, this was observed. In the 54th regiment,
my friend, Mr Ross, then the surgeon
of it, informed me that the disease
was for some time not only confined to particular
companies, but to particular tents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
It deserves mention, too, that, till the arrival
of the Indian army at Ghiza, ophthalmia
did not appear in the army. We found at
Ghiza the 89th regiment and an ophthalmia-hospital
of the English army.</p>

<p>I believe that several diseases are contagious,
which are not suspected to arise from
such a cause: the theory of contagion is
but very imperfectly understood.</p>

<p>It was said, that the sailors, on-board the
fleet at Aboukir-bay, had the disease at the
same time that it prevailed in the army
on-shore. Several cases appeared among
the troops after we sailed from Suez.</p>

<p>Ophthalmia prevailed most from May to
December. At Kossier the disease was hardly
seen, nor at Ghenné. It was not till the
army was encamped at Rhoda, in August,
that cases crowded in on us. In that, and
the two following months, most of the cases
made their appearance.</p>

<p>It will be seen, in part the first of these
sketches, that, in the months of January,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
February, March, and April, very few
cases appear in the reports.</p>

<p>About the middle of May the disease
began to appear in Alexandria.</p>

<p>Some of our medical gentlemen thought
this disease very different from the ophthalmia
which they had seen in Europe or in India.
In several circumstances there certainly was
a difference, and we were obliged to have
recourse to a different mode of treatment,
finding we did not succeed with that pursued
in England or in India. The disease,
I think, might generally be resolved into,
1st, either of Cullen’s two species, the
ophthalmia tarsi and the ophthalmia membranarum;
2ndly, to a combination of these
two; or, 3dly, to a species of ophthalmia,
frequent in India, symptomatic of disease
in the biliary secretion.</p>

<p>The appearance which the disease put on,
particularly the two first species of it, was
nearly what we have seen in other parts of
the world; except that the symptoms advanced
with alarming rapidity to the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
inflammatory stages. In most cases the
attack was sudden, and very generally at
night. Speedily, the patient complained
of a burning heat of the eye-ball, or of
a sensation of needles being passed through
the eye. There was a considerable swelling
of the ball of the eye, of the eye-lids, and
sometimes of the neighbouring parts. Almost
always, there was a copious flow of
tears, which felt hot and scalding, and, as
they flowed down, excoriated the face.
Very frequently, there was a racking headach
and general fever. Œdema of the
eye-lids was frequently met with in the
early stage of the disease, and inversion
of the cilia in the last stages.</p>

<p>The disease very often continued two or
three months: after it had continued some
time, the general health became much
impaired. It often terminated in diarrhœa
or dysentery, and sometimes the patient
became hectic.</p>

<p>In the third species of the disease, which I
have mentioned, there was not so much active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
inflammation as in the other two species;
and it was generally known by a yellow
tinge of the adnata, or by dyspeptic symptoms
being present; though, sometimes,
we have seen those appearances absent: and
no topical application had any effect in
removing the ophthalmia, till the gums
were affected by calomel or some mercurial
preparation.</p>

<p>In the two first species of the disease,
the inflammation, in a great many instances,
induced fever of many days duration, and
the disease too frequently terminated in opacity
of the cornea or in suppuration of the
eye-ball.</p>

<p>In the treatment, it appears, from the
reports, that different gentlemen followed
very different modes. We said, in general,
that the European practice did not succeed.
Scarification and astringent collyria, in the
first stage, gave intolerable pain, and generally
aggravated the symptoms.</p>

<p>The practice of the natives, was, to apply,
in the first stage, emollient decoctions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
their plants, and poultices of the kali. In
the last stage, they rely much on the frequently
bathing of the eye in the cold water
of the Nile: they are likewise very fond
of bleeding; and I understood that sometimes
they use the actual cautery, burning
behind the ear where we usually apply
blisters.</p>

<p>The practice, which appeared to be by
far the most successful, was the following:</p>

<p>For the first twenty-four or thirty-six
hours after admission, the eyes of every
patient were carefully syringed with tepid
water, which had been filtered carefully.
The syringing was performed from three
to six times in the day; the light was
carefully excluded, the patient kept cool,
and every other part of the anti-phlogistic
regimen strictly enforced. After the above
period, a weak solution of sugar of lead,
or of camphor, or vitrolated zinc, was applied.
Where the pain was much complained
of, a solution of opium was added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to the collyrium; opium was applied in
a cataplasm, or two or three drops of
laudanum were let fall into the eye.</p>

<p>If there was much swelling, a saturnine
poultice, or the coagulum alluminosum,
was applied to the eyes. I observed, that
blistering a large surface, and as near as
possible to the seat of the pain, if kept
discharging for some time, always afforded
great relief.</p>

<p>To remove the fever and to alleviate the
distressing pain, we often gave opium internally
in a considerable quantity, and
with great advantage.</p>

<p>Setons in the neck and the free use
of bark appeared to be of the greatest
service, when the disease was of long
standing.</p>

<p>In opacity of the cornea, and when
there were specks, several gentlemen
thought highly of the aqua phagedænica
of the old pharmacopeias, after having
divided the vessels which went to the
speck. It gave very pungent pain; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
I have seen great relief from it, and also
from a solution of lunar caustic.</p>

<p>As a collyrium in Egypt, I often gave
with considerable benefit what I found
in the hands of the black doctors in India,
viz. a tea spoonful of lime-juice to
four table spoonfuls of water, or a tea
spoonful of arrack to two table spoonfuls
of water. In the first stage, I would
have applied leeches, but never could procure
them.</p>

<p>In Persia, Dr Short, informs me, that
he was very successful in the general use
of an ointment, composed of white vitriol,
tuttey, and cinnabar, after the application
of leeches and scarification.</p>

<p>From the days of Prosper Alpinus, the
salts contained in the soil of Egypt have
been supposed to be among the principal
causes of the ophthalmia of the country.
Though the various modifications of light
and heat no doubt act as existing causes;
yet to the particular soil of Egypt, and
to the constitution of the air there, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
must look for the regular and the principal
causes of this disease.</p>

<p>In Egypt several causes occurred, which
in any country, separately applied, would be
adequate to the production of violent ophthalmia.
The dry, white, dazzling, soil, and
the fine sand and dust constantly thrown
about in whirlwinds and entering every
crevice. If an ophthalmia is epidemical
or is endemic in Egypt, the above causes
will render it a very violent disease.</p>

<p>But I conceive, that, of themselves and
alone, these circumstances do not produce
the violent ophthalmia seen in Egypt. In
no place did these circumstances exist in
greater force than at Kossier, on the march
across the Great Desert, and at Ghenné.
Yet, till our arrival at Ghiza, the disease
did not appear. These circumstances likewise
exist in great force in most places
of India, where the ophthalmia occasionally
occurs from them, yet it is different
from the two first species of the Egyptian
ophthalmia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>For the production of the third species
of this disease, the same causes will account,
which produce dysentery, hepatitis,
and other diseases of the liver. In Egypt,
I remarked, that most of the cases of
this species occurred at the time that dysentery
prevailed the most.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned, that, in Egypt,
the natives are universally impressed with
the idea, that sleeping in the night-air
brings on the disease.</p>

<p>In the ophthalmia of Egypt, as in the
plague, it would appear, that very much
may be done in the prevention.</p>

<p>It could not escape observation, how
rarely officers were the subjects of this
disease. In accounting for this, I lay most
stress on the attention which officers pay
to cleanliness. In the 88th regiment,
where, I believe, forty men did not escape
an attack, only two officers out of thirty
had ophthalmia.</p>

<p>In the whole of the Indian army, only
one officer lost an eye by it, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
was Ensign Paton, of the 86th regiment.</p>

<p>The exemption of the officers from the
ophthalmia gives more weight to the
opinion, that in Egypt this disease is communicated
by contagion.</p>

<p>Mr Paton, previously to embracing the
military profession, had studied medicine;
and, when medical assistance was much
wanted, and a great many of his corps
were laid up with the ophthalmia, he
very humanely offered to attend them.
When employed in this duty, he was himself
attacked with the disease and suffered
most severely by it for many months.</p>

<p>Mr Bellars, about this time, joined the
86th regiment at Ghiza; he took charge
of the sick, and was attacked in the same
manner as Mr Paton had been, and he
likewise suffered most severely by it for
several months.</p>

<p>Dr Whyte, who fell a martyr to his
zeal in the investigation of the history of
the plague, from a residence of some years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in the Levant and some time in Egypt,
had good opportunities of being acquainted
with the diseases of that country, informed
me, that, by making those under his charge,
frequently during the day, wash the eyes
with cold water in the season of the ophthalmia,
he never failed in preventing the
disease. He instanced particularly the sailors
of the transports, of about one thousand
of whom he had the medical charge.
The captains of the different transports
carried Dr Whyte’s preventive instructions
into execution; and, though the disease
raged both in the army and the navy,
few of the sailors of the transports had it.
By an attention to this mode of prevention,
and in the season when the ophthalmia
prevails most, making the soldiers
wear something over the eyes, I think we
should have the prospect of passing a second
campaign, or season in Egypt, with
less loss from ophthalmia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<h3>GENERAL REMARKS ON THE DISEASES.</h3>

<p>I have dwelt a considerable time on
the two endemics, the plague and ophthalmia,
the only diseases which we found
peculiar to Egypt; and there do not many
more diseases remain to detain us.</p>

<p>We come next to a class including several
diseases, and which are usually described
separately: but, I am at a loss how
to disunite them, as they occur all of them
in India, and as they have for the most part
appeared in the Indian army in Egypt.
The diseases are fever, hepatitis, and dysentery;
and, as I have for the most part
seen them, there exists among them a
most intimate and natural connection. For
a long time, the same causes appeared
indifferently to produce them: there was
a frequent transmutation of these diseases
one into another, and in the three diseases
we succeeded by a similar treatment. In
offering a few remarks, however, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
preserve a distinction, and speak of these
diseases separately. Before entering on
them I may remark, that the effects of
the solo-lunar influence, so remarkable
in fever hepatitis and dysentery in India,
were in Egypt likewise very observable.
In the treatment of these diseases the
practitioner found his account in attending
to the periods of the moon; at the
full and the change, paroxysms would frequently
supervene, if not anticipated;
and, at these periods, convalescents would
frequently suffer a relapse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<h3>OF FEVER.</h3>

<p>The fever which we had in Egypt, at
different stations and in different seasons
of the year, assumed various types.
That which, on the outset, prevailed
among the Bombay Sepoys, was remittent.
At Ghenné, the fever in the
10th regiment was continued; but it very
often terminated in hepatitis. At Ghiza,
we have said that we suspected contagion
as the cause, at first; but, in the end, the
disease was clearly kept up by marshy
effluvia on Rhoda Island. It assumed a
remittent, and sometimes an intermittent,
form, when brought down to Rosetta;
and many of the cases terminated in dysentery.
At El Hammed, a majority of
the fevers which occurred were intermittents;
but several remittents occurred,
and a few cases which had some resemblance
to typhus. After October, fever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
was a disease of rare occurrence. In the
last general return for November, fifty
cases appear, of which thirty-four were
natives of India. The last return in December
is much the same, the native corps
having a majority of the cases.</p>

<p>In the last return of January there appear,
of continued fever, twenty-two cases;
twelve of whom were Europeans. Of
intermittents there were thirty-two cases,
and sixteen of them were Europeans. In
the general report of the 26th of February
the total of fever in the army is only
twenty-three, and of them, only six are
natives. On the 26th of April, we had
only fourteen cases, of which three were
natives. In May, fever did not appear
in the reports.</p>

<p>Though fever, as it appeared in the
Indian army in Egypt, at different periods,
occurred with some variation;
and though particular symptoms called
for occasional variation in the treatment;
yet, in its general character, the disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
was the same, the proximate cause appeared
to be the same, and the same
general indication was required to be kept
in view in the cure. I am inclined to believe,
that, under different names, the
same fever prevails over the peninsula of
India, and over the eastern islands; and,
perhaps, I might venture to extend the
remark to the countries between the tropics.
This fever has been often well described,
under the name of the remittent
fever of Bengal. Dr Lind, of Windsor, several
years ago, gave an excellent and concise
account of it in his Thesis. In Bengal,
it is known under the name of the pucca
fever. In Madras and on the Coromandel
coast, it is the jungle fever. At Bombay
and on the Malabar coast, it is known
under the same name. In the army in
the Guzzerat country, to the northward of
Bombay, it is this fever which has proved
so destructive of late to our army in the
field there, opposed to the Mahrattas.
In the island of Salsette, near Bombay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
it pays an annual visit, on the ceasing of
the monsoon, and proves very destructive.
In 1801, on one estate, in Salsette, upwards
of forty people were attacked with this
fever in one night. I have learned from
my ingenious friend Mr Christie, surgeon-general
of Ceylon, that it was from the
same fever, that the 19th, 51st, and 80th
regiments, have been so very much reduced;
and that it was this fever which proved
so destructive in the late war with the
king of Candy. Mr Christie writes me,
that in its destructive malignancy and ravages,
particularly on the Europeans in
Ceylon, it has equalled the yellow fever of
the West Indies.</p>

<p>From many accounts of it, which I received
while in India, I am convinced,
that the dreadful fever which prevails in
Batavia is the same disease. In Batavia,
the mortality from this fever is prodigious;
it is not exceeded by that from the
plague in Egypt, or from the yellow fever
in America. Different circumstances, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
would appear, concur to the production
of the disease, in a very aggravated form,
in the Dutch settlement of Batavia; of
which, we may mention the extreme
unhealthiness of the situation, and the bad
practice of the Dutch surgeons.</p>

<p>Dr Griffith, surgeon to the naval hospitals
in India, informed me, that, when
our fleet lay off Batavia, in 1801, it prevailed
very much; but that, when they
got the management of patients early,
they were generally successful in the
treatment of the disease. Bencoolen is
one of the most unhealthy of our eastern
settlements, solely from the prevalence of
this fever. In China, it appears likewise
to be a frequent and fatal disease.</p>

<p>Having said thus much on the identity
of the fever which appeared in Egypt,
with that which is seen in India, and in
the eastern islands, I shall proceed to the
treatment. The first step was to cleanse
the primæ viæ, and some gave emetics:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
this, however, was not always necessary;
and purging with calomel, and the neutral
salts, appeared in most cases to answer
the same intention. In the first stage,
likewise, as particular symptoms called
for them, venæsection was performed,
blisters were applied, we determined to
the skin, or gave opiates. However, if
the fever was of any duration, the practice
always was, to endeavour to affect the
mouth as speedily as possible with mercury.
This was the practice in continued
fever, and in Egypt, as in India, we were
very generally successful, if application
was early made. In the destructive fever
of Ceylon, Mr Christie says, that he has
practised but with a moderate share of
success: but that the affecting the system
by mercury is by far the most successful
of different modes of treatment
which he had tried. He gave nitric-acid,
but in a very small quantity. In the
fleet, when stationed near Batavia, Dr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Griffiths gave mercury more liberally than
any practitioner I know. He likewise
used the nitric-acid very freely, both externally
and internally, and relied much
on its combined use with mercury. By
two very able practitioners, Dr Keir and
Mr Stewart, the Salsette fever has been
successfully treated by nitric-acid alone;
purgatives having been previously exhibited.
Some practitioners treated intermittents
by bark, some by opium, or by
giving this and the volatile alkali. It has
sometimes occurred to myself, and I have
frequently had reports from our surgeons,
that agues continued obstinate till the
gums could be affected by mercury.</p>

<p>From a very intelligent officer I had a
detail, regarding the Batavia fever, so
remarkable, that I shall here insert it.
This gentleman is the captain of a ship in
India, who, in different voyages which
he had made to Batavia, had constantly
lost great numbers of his ship’s crews.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
In his last voyage, when in a certain latitude,
and as he approached Batavia,
he gave daily to each of his men a few
grains of the mass of the blue pill. By
the time of his arrival at Batavia, he had
thus very gently affected every one of
their mouths; and, in that voyage, he
lost not a man. Would mercury thus
exhibited, as a preventive, be useful in
the plague, or in the yellow fever?</p>

<p>Before dismissing the subject of fever
I may observe that no well-marked case
of typhus occurred to us in Egypt. In
India we never saw a case of this species
of fever. To the existence of this fever,
which in Europe has committed such havoc
in our fleets and armies, the climate
of India is inimical. We know instances
where, in transports, typhus had broke
out, and, on the passage to the Cape of
Good Hope or India, had proved little
less destructive than the plague could
have done; but the disease never reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
India. If a case was landed there, it
never propagated the contagion: a
second case never appeared on shore. On
inquiry, I found that no case had ever
been known on the western side of the
peninsula, nor have I ever heard of its
existence in the eastern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<h3>HEPATITIS,
OR THE LIVER COMPLAINT.</h3>

<p>In India I have often had occasion to
remark, that the acute hepatitis, of Cullen,
was a disease of rare occurrence.
The disease which comes before us most
frequently, in India, is his chronic species;
and in that, most frequently, there
is neither pyrexia nor the “decubitus
in latus sinistrum difficilis,” which, from
having included in the definition of both
of his species, I suppose the illustrious
and accurate professor was induced to
believe was a constant symptom in this
disease. In very few of his definitions is
there room for alteration; and I hope,
for venturing here to suggest one, that I
shall not incur the charge of presumption.
But hepatitis was a disease, for accounts
of which the accurate nosologist
must have trusted to other sources than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
his own observation. It should be known,
that very often we meet with this disease,
when few of the symptoms of his definition
are found. In India I have learned
from some of the oldest practitioners,
and from some gentlemen of abilities, the
most respectable in the profession, that
very commonly hepatitis is met with
when all the symptoms of Cullen’s definition
are wanting. In that country, when
any of the abdominal viscera are complained
of, we may in general suspect
some error in the hepatic system.</p>

<p>In India, the liver seems to be the seat
of disease in nearly the same proportion
that the lungs are in England.</p>

<p>In Upper Egypt, and at Ghiza, we
had many cases of hepatitis: it was the
same disease that we had seen in India.
At Rosetta and Alexandria a few cases
did occur, accurately answering to Cullen’s
definition of the acute species. Sergeant
Levi, of the 88th regiment, was one
instance. On the 13th of October, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
was admitted into the hospital with this
disease in a most violent degree. He
had been ill only twenty-four hours: he
had high inflammatory fever; his side
was extremely tender to the touch; he
had great irritability of stomach, and pain
over the belly. He was twice bled: the
anti-phlogistic regimen was for thirty-six
hours applied in its utmost rigour: thereafter
mercury was liberally thrown in, and
he recovered. We remarked that many,
who, in India, were the frequent subjects
of repeated attacks of hepatitis, at length
never complained, or they had the disease
in the mildest shape, in Egypt.
After the month of October, hepatitis
was a disease of still more rare occurrence.
In no corps did the number of cases bear
any proportion to what they were wont
to be in India.</p>

<p>During October a considerable number
of cases occurred, but almost all of them
were Europeans: the proportion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
natives who had this disease was always
very small.</p>

<p>About the beginning of November several
fresh cases occurred, and all of them
were acute.</p>

<p>By the end of December this disease
was fast disappearing in the army. In
the last return of the month there were
only twenty-one cases, and twenty of
them were Europeans.</p>

<p>In January it still continued to decline.
In the return of the 31st of this month
there appear only nine cases, and all of
them are Europeans.</p>

<p>In the first return of February there
are only five cases, and all of them are
Europeans.</p>

<p>There was an increase in March. In
the first return of the month there were
twelve cases, and all were Europeans.</p>

<p>In the last return of April the total
number was so low as six, of which number
four were Europeans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time of embarkation, at Suez,
there was not one case reported in the
army.</p>

<p>Hepatitis appeared more in the Company’s
artillery, and in the 10th regiment,
than in any other corps of the army. For
its predominance in the latter corps, one
reason has been assigned, and which to
me appears to have had the most powerful
influence.</p>

<p>But on the whole, this disease, once
so formidable to us in India, gradually
ceased to appear in the returns of the
sick.</p>

<p>The treatment of hepatitis it is unnecessary
to dwell on: for no disease are we
provided with a more effectual or sure
remedy. If the season for applying the
remedy be not lost, we are nearly, I think,
as confident of a cure by mercury, and
the analogous remedies, as we are in a
case of syphilis by the same remedies.</p>

<p>To whom the world is indebted for the
successful treatment of hepatitis by mercury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
I cannot correctly say. The oldest
written account of this practice, that I
have seen, is in a very sensible pamphlet
by Dr Paisley, formerly of Madras.
There is another very distinct account of
it in a pamphlet by Dr Girdlestone, of
Yarmouth, formerly surgeon of a regiment
in India.</p>

<p>For the general introduction of mercury,
through the western side of the
peninsula of India during the last twenty
years, for the application of nitric acid
to the same purpose, and for the discovery
of some other preparations analogous
to these, we are indebted chiefly to
the ingenious Mr Scott, of Bombay.
About ten years ago, from some experiments
which he made on the calces of
mercury, he discovered the analogy between
them and nitric acid, and he was
the first to apply this acid to the cure of
hepatitis. Subsequently, he was led to
the use of nitric acid and other analogous
remedies in hepatitis and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
diseases, which are curable only by mercury,
a practice, of which, on a large scale
for the last six years, I have observed the
best effects, and which is now likely to
get into general use in India.</p>

<p>I have said, that the species of hepatitis
which we met with, at last, in Egypt,
was not that usually seen in India, and a
corresponding change was required in the
treatment. Previously to giving mercury
it was found necessary to premise the
anti-phlogistic regimen.</p>

<p>In the use of mercury great address is
often required; and, in substituting nitric
acid and the analogous remedies, I
am convinced, that much advantage
may often be gained. Sometimes one of
these remedies will succeed when the
other has failed; and not unfrequently
have I seen their combined use succeed
where separately given they had failed.
In obtaining a new agent we have acquired
a great deal more power in the
management of a disease, the most formidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to Europeans in the eastern
world.</p>

<p>Sometimes in Egypt, and in many instances
in India, I have observed, that
I could not affect the gums with mercury,
or with acid, till venæsection was performed.
After this operation, I have often
succeeded, and induced a flow of saliva,
in cases which had long resisted a liberal
use of mercury and nitric acid.</p>

<p>If the modern practice of giving but
little mercury, and to make it only touch
the gums, as it is called, without exciting
a flow of saliva, be proper in the venereal
disease, undoubtedly it is not in hepatitis.
This disease never yields till the
saliva flows freely—the explanation of this
I do not attempt; but the fact is as I
state it, and it is well known to every
man who has practised extensively in India.
Whenever the gums are hard, and
insensible to the effects of mercury;
when, instead of a salivation, they are
red, painful, spongy, or blue, the prognosis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
is very unfavourable: in ninety of
such cases out of the hundred we lose
our patients.</p>

<p>In the first stage of this disease, I have
derived benefit from cupping and blistering
the side; but I never allow these remedies
to interfere, or to delay the principal
indications—the affecting the gums.</p>

<p>Dissection shews us the liver, of appearances
considerably varied when this
disease has existed some time. I have
preserved notes of my dissections; they
are not few. I made a rule of inspecting
the body of every one that died under
my care for several years past. At present,
I shall only mention, in general,
that sometimes the liver was of the
natural consistence, sometimes harder, and
that it was much varied in colour; but,
generally, it was considerably increased
in size. After the disease had lasted long,
it was sometimes much wasted, and, in
a few instances, of a very small size.
In a majority of the fatal terminations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
there were found vomicæ, or abscesses.
When matter is formed, it is well known,
that it makes its escape in various ways:
here surgical aid may sometimes be of
use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<h3>DYSENTERY.</h3>

<p>This was by far the most-generally
prevailing, as well as the most fatal disease
in the army.</p>

<p>After mature deliberation, and the
most satisfactory proofs, proofs nearly
amounting to demonstration, I convinced
myself, in India, that the dysentery of that
country is a disease whose first causes
lie in the biliary system. On reflection,
and after looking over the accounts of
my practice in the West Indies, I have
little doubt but that the dysentery of that
country proceeds from the same cause.
In the end, I was led to think that dysentery,
as it occurs in Europe, was the same
disease: however, the opportunities of
observation, which I had in Egypt, convinced
me that I was wrong.</p>

<p>The dysentery which occurred in the
army till we came to the shores of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Mediterranean, and for some time after,
was clearly the dysentery of India; but,
afterwards, we witnessed a different disease.
I must confess, that, having come
to so certain a conclusion, I was not
ready to give up an opinion which appeared
to me to rest on very sure grounds;
and it was not till after much doubt,
hesitation, and careful observation, that I
became convinced, in Alexandria, that,
with the change of country and climate,
we had a different disease. This is one
proof how improper, and how unsafe, it
is for the practitioner of one climate to
sit down and describe the diseases of another.
They only who have studied the
same diseases, in various and opposite
climates, can fully comprehend the extreme
absurdity as well as fallacy of this.
From reasoning of any kind, we are incompetent
to decide on the identity of
disease. Reasoning from analogy here
always deceives. In many of the symptoms
diseases may agree; but, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
thence to infer their identity is taking a
very narrow view. The comparison will be
found to hold good only in some points,
and that we have satisfied ourselves with
an imperfect outline. Between diseases,
as they occur in Europe and in Asia,
there are just as many shades of difference
as between the plants of those opposite
regions, or in the colour of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The dysentery of India, or what I
shall term the tropical dysentery, is not
the disease which is described by Cullen
under that name. The dysentery of
Cullen, as it is faithfully described by
Sydenham, Pringle, Monro, and Sir
George Baker, is a frequent disease on
the continent of Europe; and it has ever
been a most destructive disease in our armies
there. The dysentery of Europe
I believe to be generally a disease of the
intestinal canal. I have already said that
the tropical dysentery proceeds from a
different cause; but the diseases likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
differ much in their symptoms. The
“pyrexia contagiosa” certainly forms no
part of the tropical dysentery; and the
torminia and tenesmus occur so rarely,
that, in a definition of this disease, I presume
they cannot be admitted. Spasmodic
affection of the intestinal canal, I believe,
rarely occurs in the tropical dysentery.</p>

<p>I have ever experienced difficulty in
distinguishing dysentery from diarrhæa,
and am inclined to think, that, in Cullen’s
definition of diarrhæa, is described tropical
dysentery. The diarrhæa biliosa,
as well as his seventh species, the diarrhæa
hepatirrhea, perhaps, ought to be
included in a definition of tropical dysentery.</p>

<p>It has been already mentioned, that it
was the tropical dysentery which principally
prevailed in the army. Though I
was not convinced that we had a different
disease, till after we came to Alexandria,
yet I am inclined to think that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
was the European disease which chiefly
prevailed in the army for some time before;
and, if we draw the line from November,
we shall not be far removed from
the truth.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to say much in
the treatment of tropical dysentery. Mercury
is now the remedy relied on every
where. In Egypt, we felt the want of
nitric acid in hepatitis; and we equally
felt the want of this powerful remedy in
dysentery. The instances which have occurred
to me, during the last five years,
are extremely numerous, where, after
our failure with mercury, exhibited in all
the variety of its preparations, we succeeded
with this remedy sometimes as a
substitute, and sometimes as an auxiliary.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in the 61st regiment that cases
of the dysentery of Europe were first observed.
Perhaps it more readily appeared
in this corps, because the greatest part of
the men had not yet got rid of the European
habit, and were as yet unassimilated
to a warm climate. After repeated
failures, and losing some men, Mr Ruxton
saw the necessity of giving trial to
other remedies than mercury.</p>

<p>The disease generally set in with a
smart fever, and, unless the calomel exhibited
went through the bowels, the patient
felt no relief: and Mr Ruxton
remarked, that the neutral salts gave this
relief much more perfectly than calomel.
The treatment which Mr Ruxton rested
on, and with which he was at length successful,
was, in most cases, putting the
patient on the anti-phlogistic regimen;
frequently giving laxatives; and keeping
up a determination to the skin. The
same practice was followed in the few
fresh cases which occurred in the 88th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
regiment at Alexandria, and in a considerable
number of cases in the hospital
of the 10th regiment, and some other
corps. However, it must be mentioned,
that to the last period some cases did
occur, in all these corps, where calomel
was found necessary. When the disease
was of some weeks standing, and where
a chronic disease occurred, calomel given
in small doses proved the best and indeed
only useful remedy.</p>

<p>For a long time, we saw but little
dysentery in the army. The number of
cases which occurred, before we arrived
in Lower Egypt, was inconsiderable.</p>

<p>In September, a great many cases occurred
in the neighbourhood of Rosetta,
and in the camp at El Hammed; but
many of these were the sequelæ of the
fever contracted at Rhoda. In October,
the number of cases was greatly
on the increase. The rainy weather with
which the month of November began,
and which continued during the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
months, brought a prodigious increase
of dysenteric cases. In the general
return of the first week in November,
there appear one hundred and sixty cases,
and one hundred and twenty-three of
these are Europeans. Most of the natives
were from the Bengal volunteer
battalion.</p>

<p>In the first general return in December
appear two hundred and nineteen; of
which one hundred and forty are Europeans.</p>

<p>After leaving the encampment at El
Hammed, and getting into dry, comfortable
barracks, at Alexandria, the disease
occurred more rarely in the army.</p>

<p>In the last return of January, only one
hundred and sixty cases are seen.</p>

<p>In the last return of February, the total
number of dysenteric cases in the army
was fifty-four, and only twenty-two of
these were natives of India.</p>

<p>In the last return of March, there appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
nineteen cases, fifteen of which were
Europeans.</p>

<p>There are only twenty cases in the last
return of April, and these cases are equally
divided between the Europeans and
Indians.</p>

<p>At the time of embarkation the number
was even less than the above.</p>

<p>The disease was more frequently met
with among the European artillery, and
in the 61st regiment, than in any other
corps. Among the native corps, the Bengal
battalion had more of the disease
than any other. I made inquiry, but
could find no reason that could with probability
account for this.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>I have continued longer on the subject
of dysentery than was at first my intention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
I will confess, that I think it is a subject
on which I could with more propriety
speak than on any other. My opportunities
of seeing the disease have been no
common ones. Rarely, I believe, has it
fallen to the lot of an individual to see so
very many cases of one disease in such a
diversity of climate and situation. In the
88th regiment, during the course of upwards
of ten years, I saw the same men
the subject of this disease on the continent
of Europe, in America, in both extremities
of Africa, and in India. Of late,
it has afforded me not a little amusement
to review my notes as well as my journals
of practice in this disease, in all these
quarters.</p>

<p>I have now both given some account of
the endemic diseases which we met with
in Egypt, and offered a few remarks on
those diseases which were most prevalent
in the army. They are the diseases
which constantly prove the most fatal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
an army in India. The few which now
remain, or (if I may be allowed the expression)
the minor diseases, will not long
detain us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<h3>PNEUMONIA AND RHEUMATISM</h3>

<p>I shall speak of conjointly. In the
symptoms or treatment we could not observe
any difference from the same diseases
as they occur in Europe. If these
diseases were less violent than we have seen
them in Europe, they had more of the inflammatory,
diathesis than in India.</p>

<p>It was not till after the army had been
sometime in Lower Egypt, that either of
these diseases appeared.</p>

<p>In the first general weekly return in November,
there appear a total of six cases
of pneumonia, and nine of rheumatism.</p>

<p>In the first week of December, there
were twelve cases of pneumonia, and seven
of rheumatism.</p>

<p>In the first weekly return of January,
both diseases appear to have increased;
there were twenty-four cases of pneumonia,
and twenty of rheumatism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first return of February, there
are thirty-four cases of pneumonia, of
which number, twenty were Europeans.
Of rheumatism, there were fifteen, and
only eight of them were Europeans.</p>

<p>In March, the first return presents only
five cases of pneumonia: of these, three
were Europeans; but, of rheumatism,
there were twenty-seven cases, and nineteen
of them were natives of India.</p>

<p>In April, there were sixteen cases of
pneumonia, and only five were Europeans.
Of twenty-five cases of rheumatism,
eleven are Europeans.</p>

<p>The warm clothing and bedding provided
by the General for the natives of
India, in the cold months, no doubt protected
them from the attacks of pneumonia
and rheumatism. The latter disease
was found to be more prevalent in the
Bengal battalion of Sepoys than in any
other corps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<h3>SMALL-POX.</h3>

<p>The cases of this disease that occurred
were very few. I have said that the
small-pox broke out at sea, in the division
of the army commanded by colonel Murray.
Mr Philips told me, that it was very
fatal to the natives: he sent every case as
soon as discovered into the Julia hospital
ship, which was unfortunately lost, in the
Red Sea, with all on board.</p>

<p>The Europeans, who were attacked in
Egypt with this disease, all did well; but
it proved a very fatal disease to the few
Indians whom it attacked.</p>

<p>As in India, we remarked, that in
Egypt the contagion did not spread so
widely as in Europe. Though, at different
periods, it broke out in the hospital of the
10th regiment, at Rosetta, in the department
of the commissary of cattle, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
encamped near the lake Mareotis, and in
the garrison of Ghiza, yet in none of these
instances did the disease spread. The
cases that did occur were all of them
very confluent. When, on the eve of our
march to Suez, I received vaccine matter,
sent from Constantinople by order of
Lord Elgin: it arrived too late, however,
for us to introduce the new inoculation
either in the army, or the country; it was
likewise too old and unfit to be carried
into India, as we intended.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> At one time
I expected to see a curious question in
physiology resolved, by observing the
united agency of the variolous, and pestilential
contagions. In one instance,
these two poisons were in action in one
corps, and at one time. A case of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
small-pox, and another of the plague,
broke out, in the camp of the commissary
of cattle, at the same time. By the active
vigilance, and the system established
there, the progress of both contagions was
soon stopped, and a second case of either
disease did not afterwards occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<h3>DIARRHÆA.</h3>

<p>I have said, that, from the quality of
the water, this was a prevailing disease
in crossing the desert of Thebes. It occasionally
appeared, at other times, in
some corps, particularly after a change
of provisions, or after changing quarters,
as from El Hammed to Alexandria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<h3>SCURVY.</h3>

<p>This disease was but little seen in the
army. About twenty cases occurred in
the 61st regiment while quartered in the
Pharos, and one case occurred in the
80th regiment at Alexandria. At the
time the disease occurred, the army was
regularly supplied with fresh vegetables,
and there was no scarcity of provisions in
the market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<h3>SYPHILIS.</h3>

<p>This disease prevailed much in the
garrison of Ghiza, and in the 86th regiment.
At the time of embarkation there
were many obstinate cases. With the
small stock of nitric acid which we had,
we had as strong proofs of its efficacy as
in India. In the instances of some officers
who were successfully treated with
it, we found that the stomach seldom
bore more than half the quantity which,
in Bombay, we had usually exhibited in
the hospital of the 88th regiment; but
the acid given to these cases differed much
from the acid used in India: the latter
was a much pleasanter remedy.</p>

<p>To a few cases we successfully gave the
oxymuriate of potash, and to several
cases the oxymuriate of soda.</p>

<p>We found that syphilis was a frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
disease in every part of Egypt that we
had seen, both among the Bedouins and
the Fellahs; and we have seen in Upper
Egypt many objects terribly mutilated
from this disease. Crude mercury I have
often seen in their bazars, or markets,
and they appeared to be acquainted with
the use of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE GUINEA-WORM.</h3>

<p>This did not frequently appear in the
Indian army while they were in Egypt:
on the voyage thither, however, it prevailed
very much, and a great deal of it
came under my own particular notice.
On my return to India I found, that, in
the manner of its first appearance, as well
as in its progress afterwards, much of
what I had observed was considered, by
medical men, as new and remarkable. I
shall, therefore, give some detail of it
here: though this may be going a little
out of my way, it may be useful. When
cases of this disease crowded on me,
and with the very severe symptoms with
which they appeared, I was both perplexed
and embarrassed; and I regretted
much the not having had a previous
knowledge of the disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>This disease, as will be shewn by the
table, was but little seen in Egypt. It
appeared only in two European corps,
the 86th and 88th regiments; and in two
native Indian corps, the 1st and 7th
Bombay regiments. It is a disease, of
which I believe that we know but little.
Industry and attention might be usefully
employed in the investigation of the natural
history of the dracunculus.</p>

<p>In September, 1799, the 86th regiment
relieved the 84th in the fort of Bombay.
The 86th remained in the king’s barracks
there until October, 1800, at which time
they were relieved by the 88th regiment
from the island of Coulabah.</p>

<p>The 86th, on coming into the fort of
Bombay, had never had a case of the
Guinea-worm; and they continued free
from it till the setting in of the monsoon
of 1800. The king’s barracks in the fort
are close to the bazar in Bombay. Here
Mr Dean, the surgeon of the 86th regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
remarked, that the Guinea-worm prevailed
very much among the natives. In the
course of the monsoon, nearly three hundred
cases of this disease appeared in the
86th regiment. I saw, at one time, one
hundred cases of it in Mr Dean’s hospital.</p>

<p>The 88th regiment, from the time of
their arrival in India, in June, 1799, till
October, 1800, was quartered in the
island of Coulabah, distant one mile from
Bombay. During the fifteen months of
their stay at Coulabah, only one case of
Guinea-worm appeared in the regiment;
and this happened, as they were about
exchanging quarters with the 86th regiment,
in an old man, debilitated with repeated
attacks of hepatitis and dysentery.
No case appeared in the 88th regiment
in October, nor for nearly a
month after their coming into the king’s
barracks in Bombay; but, in that part of
November which immediately preceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
their embarkation for service, three cases
occurred.</p>

<p>The artillery, 86th and 88th regiments,
as already mentioned, were embarked, at
Bombay, for the Egyptian expedition.
In the course of the voyage to Ceylon,
a case of Guinea-worm first appeared in
the detachment of the 86th regiment, on
board the Minerva; and, thereafter, six
cases in the 88th regiment, on board the
same ship.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Point de Galle, in
Ceylon, we found that the disease was
unknown in his Majesty’s 19th foot,
among the Sepoys who came from Bengal
or Madras; in the Malay corps: and, as
far as I could learn, among the inhabitants.
During our stay in Ceylon, a few
cases made their appearance in the 86th
and 88th regiments on shore. On sailing
from this island for the Red Sea, only
three hundred and sixty men, of the 88th
regiment, with the artillery, were embarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
in the Minerva. Two companies of
the 88th were embarked in a small vessel,
the Fancy. Another vessel, the Hope,
was provided for the detachment of the
86th regiment, and two officers of the
88th were embarked with them.</p>

<p>Soon after sailing from Ceylon, the
Guinea-worm made its appearance among
the 88th, both in the Minerva and Fancy:
in the Minerva, particularly, it increased
with alarming rapidity. By the time we
reached the Straits of Babelmandel, we
were in a most alarming state. Of three
hundred and sixty men, whose services
we had reason to expect daily might be
required, one hundred and sixty-one were
at this time crippled and laid up with
this loathsome disease. Though contrary
to every account which I had had of the
disease, many circumstances at this time
led me to suspect that it was infectious,
and I, at length, thought it prudent to
treat it as such.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>The officers remarked, that it prevailed
most in particular parts of the ship, and
much more in some companies than in
others. This, at length, so much struck
the commanding officer, that the sick
were separated from the sound: the men
with the Guinea-worm were all placed on
the orlop-deck, and the rest of the men
occupied the gun-deck. At this time,
too, extraordinary precautions, regarding
cleanliness and ventilation, were adopted.
Much lumber and luggage were stowed
away, and the space between decks,
which hitherto had been lumbered with
it, was made open and clear, fore and aft.
The decks were daily well washed with
boiling water, and the nitrous fumigation
was kept constantly going on throughout
the ship. Besides the usual bathing three
times a week, of all on board, the soldiers
were made to wash their hands and feet
regularly twice every day at the ship’s
head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>In a little time after adopting these
measures, we could perceive the disease
to diminish. The number of fresh cases
reported, decreased daily; and at the
time of our casting anchor in Kossier
Roads, though there were on the sick
list many bad ulcers from the Guinea-worm,
no fresh case had appeared for
some days before.</p>

<p>During the voyage, 199 cases had appeared
from 360 men of the 88th regiment;
and several cases occurred among
the ship’s crew; but not a single case
occurred among the artillery. This struck
every one on board, very early, as remarkable;
yet these men had the same provisions,
drank the same water, and in every
other circumstance were situated as the
men of the 88th regiment, except that they
were kept separate. From the outset, the
artillerymen were accommodated apart,
on the gun-deck, in a spot divided off
for themselves. Not one of the officers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
either of the artillery, 88th, or belonging
to the ship, had the Guinea-worm.
From the strong circumstances which in
its course appeared, every officer on
board was impressed with the opinion
of its being contagious, and was inclined
to use every precaution of prevention;
from which, most probably, all escaped
this filthy and severe disease.</p>

<p>Those embarked in the Fancy, were
not so fortunate; few of the men there
escaped the disease. Of eight officers of
the 88th, three caught it. Mr Bruce,
then the assistant surgeon, was one of
these: he had a worm in each leg. The
Fancy was obliged to return to Bombay;
most of the men were disabled by this
disease; and the season was too far advanced
for her getting up the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Among the 86th regiment in the Hope,
only three cases occurred; and one of
the two officers of the 88th, on board,
was one of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>I find, by my case-books, that in the
part of the 88th regiment which continued
in the Minerva, the disease appeared
as follows:</p>

</table>

<p>I have purposely excluded the cases
which occurred in the 88th, on board the
Fancy, or among the 86th regiment.</p>

<p>The disease was pretty uniform in the
manner of its appearance. The patient
was first sensible of an itching; and, on
looking at the part, generally observed
a small blister: sometimes I have seen
three or four small blisters, and the part
having the appearance of being stung
with nettles. When the blister was snipped,
a piece of mucus of the breadth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
a sixpence was seen underneath, which
being removed, the head of the worm
was seen. It was in general firmly attached,
and required force to detach it
from the parts underneath. When detached
with the forceps, we twisted it
round a ligature or piece of lint, and
thus, often on the first day, succeeded in
extracting a foot, or even two, of the
worm. It resembled much what is called
bobbin, and was about the same size. It
was transparent and moist, a white liquid
being seen in it. We continued, daily, extracting
as much of it as would come
out with gentle pulling. It was always
dangerous to pull strongly, for fear of
breaking the worm: it then occasioned the
most acute pain, and there followed much
swelling, with inflammation of the neighbouring
parts, sometimes of two or
three weeks continuance, when the worm
would shew itself at another part, as at
first, with itching and a blister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>It seldom appeared to be deeply
seated; generally, under the cutis, or
among the tela cellulosa, when we could
often trace it in its course, and sometimes
see it: sometimes it was under the
fascia, and but seldom among the muscles.</p>

<p>If not ushered in with fever, it was
almost always attended with it in its
course: when there was considerable inflammation,
it ran very high. In seven
cases, mortification took place, and very
large sloughs were cast off. In a few
cases, there was a very considerable and
alarming hæmorrhage.</p>

<p>By presenting itself at different places, it
would often leave two or three large, foul,
and fistulous ulcers in different parts of a
limb. When the inflammation has run
very high, as I have often seen of the
whole leg or thigh; and when a profuse
suppuration followed; the worm frequently
has come out dead, often in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
pieces, with the sanies, by which, probably,
it had been eroded and killed.</p>

<p>Frequently, after extracting one worm
from a patient, a second, a third, or even
a fourth, would appear: after getting one
out of a leg, a second would appear in
the other, a third in one hand, and a
fourth in the other hand.</p>

<p>The Guinea-worm, I believe, has been
seen in every part of the body. Though
the extremities appear to be its favourite
seats, yet the face, breast, back, penis,
&amp;c. are not exempted from its visits. I
heard of a gentleman in Bombay who
had one in his scrotum and penis, and of
a lady who had one in the pudenda.</p>

<p>The following I extract from my case-book
and notes, taken on board the Minerva,
by which it will be seen that the
extremities are as much more frequently
its principal and first seat, as in the itch.</p>

<p>As to the causes of the appearance of
the Guinea-worm, and the mode in
which it is generated, I must confess that
I have no account that I could venture
to offer here.</p>

<p>In different parts of the world, the
water drank is accused of occasioning
intestinal worms, as the tænia in Switzerland,
and the tænia and the teretes
in the West Indies; where, likewise, I
have heard the mucilaginous vegetables
eaten assigned as a cause of the frequent
appearance of worms. In Russia, there
is a worm, the lumbricus militensis, common
near swampy grounds. In Russia
and in Siberia, in the same situations,
the tænia infernalis prevails. But, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
what has been here stated, we cannot
bring the water, drank on board the
Minerva, or at Bombay, to account for
the Guinea-worm which prevailed: in
fact, the water came from different and
distant quarters, Bombay, Ceylon, and
Madras. Besides, the officers of the
38th, and the artillery, drank the same
water, and escaped.</p>

<p>No case of Guinea-worm had been
known among either the Lascars or European
sailors in the Minerva, when the
86th and 88th embarked in her.</p>

<p>I have good reason to think that the
spreading of the Guinea-worm may be
stopped, whenever it does appear. The
means which we adopted appeared to
succeed. Extreme attention to cleanliness
is indispensably necessary.</p>

<p>In India, the native doctors are much
more successful in getting out the worms,
than Europeans. After long feeling with
their fingers, for the body of the worm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
they make an incision as nearly as they
can judge over its middle, and, pulling
the worm by a duplicature of it, draw out
both ends of the worm at one time. I
have often endeavoured to imitate this
practice. My sense of touch was not so
delicate, and did not guide me so correctly,
as it did the Hindoo doctors; but
I always found that when, on cutting
down to it, I got on the middle of the
worm, and, by the forceps, pulled this
out, I could with ease extract a large
portion, and, not unfrequently, the whole
worm.</p>

<p>Leeches, astringent and sedative lotions,
cataplasms, fomentations, &amp;c. were
applied, as required by the circumstances
of the case. A good deal of attention
was paid to the disease, in all its stages;
and several experiments were made on
the worm, which, however, it is needless
to detail here.</p>

<p>After using a variety of articles, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
treatment of the Guinea-worm, and making
them enter the system by the absorbents,
I think that unctuous substances
succeeded the best, particularly mercurial
ointment. Passing an electrical shock
through the part had no effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<h3>ULCERS.</h3>

<p>In India, we remarked that ulcers,
particularly of the legs, were very rarely
seen; and that many men in the 88th
regiment, who in Europe were always in
hospitals with them, were in India quite
free from them. In Egypt, they began
to re-appear. In the course of six weeks
after the army came to Alexandria, there
appeared seventy on the general return
of the army; and they continued afterwards
on the increase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<h3>TETANUS.</h3>

<p>Though no case of this disease occurred
to us while in Egypt, I met with
a severe one on the voyage thither. As
I was successful in this case, and by a
mode of treatment which, with the theory
which gave rise to it, is, I believe, now
considered as obsolete, it may not be uninteresting
to mention what led me to
give it a trial.</p>

<p>In the year 1794, the first tetanic case
I met with, occurred at Bergen-op-Zoom.
A sergeant of the 88th regiment, after
remaining drunk out all night, was in the
morning found lying in a ditch. This
was in August, and the weather was unusually
warm. When brought to the hospital,
his jaws were so firmly locked, that
the blade of a pen-knife could not be
introduced between the teeth. Mercury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
was had recourse to, but in a few hours
the muscles of the neck became convulsed.
By the advice of a Dutch physician,
a man of great eminence, I
immersed my patient four times, in the
course of the day, into a bath of broth.
He continued in it half an hour each
time, and, after he came out, his whole
body was rubbed with mercurial ointment.
I do not recollect that any thing else
was given to him, unless a stimulant
enema. Next morning the good effects
of the Dutch practice were evident: a
violent salivation came on, and, in about
three weeks, the man was doing his
duty.</p>

<p>In the next case which occurred,
though a cure was not completely effected,
the same treatment was, for some
days, attended with good effects. In the
island of Grenada, a negro, attached to
our pioneers, received a contusion and a
slight wound of the head, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
soon followed by locked jaw. The warm
bath, and the liberal use of mercury,
were ordered. He, for some time, appeared
to be better, and I flattered
myself with the hopes of another cure;
but the disease gaining ground, the cold
bath and the tonic treatment were had
recourse to. The patient died.</p>

<p>The next was a sailor, who, a few days
before our embarkation, in the Minerva,
at Bombay, had been slightly wounded
in the foot by a copper nail. On my first
seeing him, his symptoms were slight,
but were gaining ground fast. On the
10th of December, the day after our
embarkation, he had the most violent
symptoms of the disease: the jaws were
firmly locked; the muscles of the neck,
before and behind, were strongly convulsed;
and he had twitchings of the
muscles of his face. He pointed to the
region of the stomach, where, he afterwards
told me, that he had intolerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
pain and sickness. This man was immediately
put under the same treatment as
was employed in the case of Sergeant
Kirkland, with this difference, that, instead
of broth, a bath was made from
fat, or what is, on ship-board, called the
slush. The same success attended; but
the symptoms yielded more slowly, and
it was several months before the sailor
recovered.</p>

<p>From hearing me relate these successful
cases, by the warm bath and mercury,
some cases in the Bombay general hospital
were treated in the same manner.
My friend, Dr Keir, informed me that he
tried it in three cases of tetanus, in the
garrison hospital. It succeeded in one,
but failed in the other two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<h3>GENERAL REMARKS ON THE YELLOW FEVER, AND THE
RESEMBLANCE WHICH THIS DISEASE BEARS TO THE PLAGUE.</h3>

<p>When I had nearly brought these
sketches to a conclusion, I met with two
books which I regret that I did not see
earlier, viz. Dr Chisholm’s work on the
Pestilential Fever of the West Indies, and
Dr Wittman’s Travels. In perusing these
works, I have had great satisfaction to
find a coincidence with me in some
opinions which I had formed, and which
I have introduced into this treatise.</p>

<p>It is matter of regret to me, that I
did not meet Dr Wittman in Egypt.
Most of my observations, I find, coincide
with his; and I am glad to have mine
confirmed by authority so respectable.</p>

<p>The frictions with oil we did use to a
small extent, in an infected corps of the
Indian army; but the report made to me,
by the surgeon, was unfavourable, and
I never recommended its use in any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
corps. Since reading what Dr Wittman
says on the subject of friction with oil,
I think it not improbable, that, in addition
to the great care which captain Burr
took of the commissariat department,
another circumstance may have conduced
to their exemption from the plague. The
camels of the army, to the number of
some hundreds, were, as well as the horses
and buffaloes, under the charge of the
commissary of cattle, captain Burr; and
his people were entrusted with the care
of them. In the cold and wet season,
which commenced in November, the
camels became very sickly, and many of
them had an eruption over the body. In
the course of three months, I believe, more
than three-fourths of these useful animals
died. Captain Burr employed some
Arabs, who were reputed to be skilful in
the treatment of the camel. The plan
which they followed I remember well.
It was, after shaving or cutting the hair
very close, to rub them all over with oil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
daily. The men of the commissariat department
were, during the day, constantly
employed in these frictions, or in tending
the cattle: and the great mortality among
the camels happened in November, December,
and January, the months in which
the plague raged the most in the army.
The circumstance I think not unworthy
of notice; I leave others to ascribe to it
what degree of importance they think it
deserving of.</p>

<p>I have mentioned, that I thought I
could see a characteristic similitude in
many of the symptoms between the plague
and the destructive fever which has for
some years devastated the continent of
America and the West India islands; and
to the end of the account which I gave of
the plague, I add a table of the principal
points where it appeared to me that the
two diseases agreed.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> I am now glad to
find, that in this opinion I do not stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
alone; I have been particularly gratified
to find that this is the opinion of so very
respectable authority as Dr Chisholm.</p>

<p>I have had the greatest satisfaction in
the perusal of the very complete history
of the West India fever which Dr Chisholm
gives. In most points, the result
of my observations on this, coincides with
the doctor’s. My experience, in a particular
situation, supplied me with some
very strong facts, touching the question
of the contagious nature of this fever.</p>

<p>From my case-books and notes, while
in the West Indies, I have thrown, under
a few heads, a brief extract of the result
of my observations, which I shall here insert.
From the similitude which I think I can
trace, this is not foreign to the principal
subject of these Sketches; and, as the result
of close observation, unattached to
any theory, they may, perhaps, be not
without interest or use.</p>

<p>1st. In Barbadoes, both in the end of 1795,
and in the beginning of 1796, the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
disease which prevailed was typhus. The
88th regiment was healthy at St Lucia,
and continued pretty healthy at Grenada
for three months after their arrival there,
or as long as they remained to the windward
side of the island. This was likewise
the case with the 10th, 25th, and other
regiments. It was only after our return
to St George’s and to Richmond Hill,
after we had communication with the 68th
regiment, and the general hospitals, where
the yellow fever had for many months
prevailed, that it appeared in the 38th,
and in the other corps.</p>

<p>2d. Before the appearance of this fever
in the 88th, as well as in other corps, dysentery
and intermittents prevailed most.</p>

<p>3d. On the 12th of July, 1796, a detachment
of the 88th regiment was embarked
at Grenada, in the Betsy transport,
for England. We embarked one hundred
and forty, and I was most particularly
careful not to take any man on board with
the slightest appearance of illness. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
precaution which regarded cleanliness,
ventilation, or fumigation, was adopted.
The remains of the 8th, 10th, 25th, and
other regiments, were at the same time
embarked, at Grenada, for England.</p>

<p>4th. From the time we sailed from
Grenada, on the 19th of July to the 5th
of August, seven days after we sailed from
Tortola, (where we had touched for water)
no case of this fever appeared in the
Betsy. The other corps, which left Grenada
along with us, had not been so fortunate.
The 8th, 10th, and 25th regiments,
all of them suffered severely on the passage
from Grenada to Tortola; the 8th
particularly. This corps, besides the loss
of many non-commissioned officers, in
this short passage, lost every officer on
board, except the surgeon in second, and
major and captain Armstrong; and these
two gentlemen were ill of the yellow fever
on coming into Tortola. I was requested
to go on board to visit them, but the request
was opposed by all the officers on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
board the Betsy, as well those of the ship
as by the officers of the 88th regiment on
board. So very much were all impressed
with an opinion of the fatally infectious
nature of this fever, that they remonstrated
with me, and told me, that the ship
and the regiment were now perfectly free
from this fever; but that, by my going
to see the 8th, I should certainly bring
the fever into the Betsy. However, a
second message having come for me to
visit captain and major Armstrong, I
instantly accompanied the messenger on
board. From seeing the state of their
transport, I immediately ordered major
and captain Armstrong on shore, and
accompanied them to the hotel. Here
we found that the prejudices in the Betsy
transport prevailed in the island of Tortola.
The doors of the hotel were shut
against the yellow fever, and it required
a very <i>forcible</i> remonstrance to persuade
them to admit these two officers, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
however, both of them, died the next day
in the hotel.</p>

<p>5th. The state of the other corps, after
sailing from Tortola, I am unacquainted
with. When lying at Tortola, on the 29th
and 30th of July, the Betsy communicated
with the transports which had the
8th and 10th regiments on board. On
the 6th of August, the first case of the
yellow fever appeared on board the
Betsy; from which period to the 12th of
September, 1796, every person almost
was once, and a great many on board
twice, attacked with this fever. Of one
hundred and forty people on board the
Betsy, the captain of the ship, eighteen
soldiers, and one woman, died in this
period. It should, however, be mentioned,
that, of the soldiers, several were
old and worn-out invalids. During the
passage from Tortola to England, our
convoy, the Hebe frigate, suffered even
more than the Betsy. When sent for on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
board, by Captain Scott, I found that
he had not only lost many seamen and
marines, but several officers, and two
medical gentlemen.</p>

<p>6th. On the fleet, from Grenada, anchoring
at Tortola, the yellow fever was
unknown there; thereafter, I have heard,
that it prevailed generally, and committed
great havoc.</p>

<p>7th. Those labouring under dysentery,
ague, &amp;c. were those first seized with this
fever.</p>

<p>8th. [<i>Symptoms.</i>]—The attack was first
with extreme debility, affection of the
head, and frequently the appearance of
drunkenness. Next, the abdomen was
complained of, and the biliary system appeared
to be a principal seat of the disease.
The yellowness, though not a constant,
was a generally attending symptom.
The eyes first appeared of a watery
suffusion; they next were observed to be
blood-shot; and, in a short time after, yellow;
from the eye, the yellowness quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
spread over all the body, and the patient
in a little time had the appearance
of one highly jaundiced. Sometimes the
yellow colour of the body continued for
some time after the patient got well, and
purgatives brought off yellow stools, while
the urine was at the same time yellowish.
The irritability of the stomach, and what
is called the black vomiting, were pretty
constant attending symptoms. The state
of the pulse varied in the course of the
disease; there was at first, almost always,
a firm and strong pulse, with so
much re-action, as would lead a stranger
to the disease to blood-letting and the
anti-phlogistic regimen. The bowels were,
in general, very unequal; there was either
a looseness or costiveness, though most
frequently the latter.</p>

<p>9th. The duration of the disease was,
in different cases, and in different situations,
very different. In Grenada, when
it first broke out, it generally ran its
course from twenty-four, thirty-six, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
forty-eight hours, in the hospitals. Soon
after we sailed from Grenada, cases terminated
in three days: thereafter, and as
we approached the higher latitudes, and
before we reached Ireland, cases were
drawn out to ten, twelve, and fifteen
days.</p>

<p>10th. The prognosis. The danger was
generally in proportion to the degree of
affection of the head, irritability of the
stomach, and yellowness of the skin, and
as these appeared early or not.</p>

<p>11th. In the treatment various modes
were tried. Emetics appeared to be unnecessary;
and, in general, seemed to do
mischief, as did all antimonials. I have
witnessed the practice of a large hospital,
where blood-letting was premised in every
case; but this was by no means a successful
practice. In three cases in the
Betsy, and where the state of the pulse
and other symptoms seemed particularly
to call for it, I performed venæsection;
but I lost my three patients. Clearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the bowels appeared to be a principal
indication: when this was repeatedly
done by drastic purgatives, and when a
free perspiration was kept up, there was
always less complaint of the head, and,
in some cases, a remission was thus obtained,
and the bark could then be given
with manifest advantage. In the few
cases where it was used to produce salivation,
calomel did more good than any
other remedy whatever. I lost no case,
where I succeeded in inducing a flow of
saliva.</p>

<p>In some cases, and these all proved fatal,
the gums became insensible to the
effects of mercury; and though one
drachm of calomel in one case, and two
scruples in another, were given in a very
short period, yet the patient died without
a flow of saliva having been excited.</p>

<p>Nothing gave more relief than the cold
bath; it generally suppressed the irritability
of stomach for some time; it always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
induced sleep, and brought out a
gentle sweat, which most commonly relieved
the patient. The Brunonian practice
I saw tried with no advantage.</p>

<p>These are the principal of the leading
circumstances, regarding the yellow fever,
which came immediately under my notice.</p>

<p>Dr Chisholm, when he formed the opinion
of the similarity of the plague and
the yellow fever, was not singular.</p>

<p>Since my arrival in England, I have
received several letters addressed to me
in Egypt, and which followed me from
that country to India, and from thence
to Europe; mostly answers to letters
which I wrote from Egypt. By two of
my West-India correspondents, in particular,
this opinion is repeatedly expressed.
I have several letters on the subject
from two most respectable physicians,
Dr Paterson, of Grenada, and Dr Robertson,
of Barbadoes. From the opinion
which he had formed, Dr Paterson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
repeatedly urges me to the use of mercury,
and of the cold bath, in the plague.</p>

<p>Dr Robertson, in one letter says, “I
decidedly agree with you, that there is a
strong similitude between the symptoms
of the yellow fever and the plague: although
the latter disease never came under
my observation, yet I was so struck
with the appearance of yellow fever, and
the histories of the other disease, which I
had read, that, at one time, I was almost
disposed to consider them both as different
modifications of the same diseased
state of body, and actually wrote a paper
on the subject in February, 1797.”</p>

<p>In the practice in Egypt, Mr Price’s
observation militates against the use of
cold bathing in the plague. It should be
recollected, however, that, when Mr
Price made his observation, it was in the
severest part of the season, when the
plague raged the most, and when Mr
Price laboured under many disadvantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
in his practice. I anxiously wish to see
cold bathing, or sponging, extensively
tried in the plague. I have great expectations
from it in that disease, from having so
often seen how much it has done
in the yellow fever and in typhus fever,
where I consider it to be the most valuable
part of the treatment.</p>

<p>In concluding, I am impelled to do an
act of justice, and acquit myself of a
debt of gratitude. The use of this invaluable
remedy, and what else I know of
tropical practice, I learned many years
ago from my venerable and much-respected
friend Dr Wright. By the use
of the cold bathing, my life was saved
in Jersey, in 1794, when I was ill of typhus
fever, by Dr Jackson, then surgeon
of the Buffs, who, at the same time, attended
my hospital for me, and with the
greatest benefit, and introduced this practice
into the 88th regiment, where typhus
then raged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The use of cold water and cold bathing
has since been diffused by the ingenious
and elegant pen of Dr Currie. This I
conceive to be one of the greatest improvements
which the practice of physic has
received in modern times.</p>

will here mention it. The letters and reports of the medical
gentlemen in the pest-houses, I constantly sewed together,
made them up in monthly volumes, and kept them at my
quarters, where every medical gentleman in the army was invited
to come and daily peruse them. The disease became
thus the subject of daily discussion; and, from these discussions,
I was enabled daily to propose queries in my letters to the
gentlemen in the pest-houses. Thus, the history of the disease,
in most of its points, came to be investigated; and, previously
to entering a pest-house, before his tour of duty came
round, every gentleman had acquired some knowledge of the
plague, and of the success of other practitioners.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> This remark we found to be particularly applicable to
the last stages of the disease. In the beginning of the season,
one case occurred that gave rise to much conversation
in the army. From having come into contact with a
case of plague, a Lascar, in the department of the commissary
of cattle, was sent into the observation-room of
the pest-house of Rosetta; he was brought there much
against his will, and contrived to make his escape from
it, on the evening of the day on which he was admitted,
though fired at by the dragoon-centries placed round the
establishment. Ineffectual search was made for him every
where in the neighbourhood of Rosetta, and we could
hear nothing of him for about five weeks, when he was
discovered at Boulac. On being brought down to
Rosetta, I examined him with Mr Guild, the surgeon of
his corps. We found him then well; but certainly he had
had the disease, for we saw an axillary bubo not quite
healed. He told us, that he remained concealed for a
great part of the time among the rushes by the side of
the river. On mentioning this case to Dr Currie, of
Liverpool, I think he said, he had heard of some similar
cases.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Since my arrival in England I see that the contagious

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Though this practice is now followed by many gentlemen
in India, yet I believe that it has been carried to a greater
extent by Messrs Dean and Bellars, of the 86th regiment,
than by any other practitioners. These gentlemen have recorded
several hundreds of cases of dysentery treated solely
by nitric mixture and bath.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> In Egypt we gave trial to a mode of treatment which was
strongly recommended to me by Dr Whyte. It was the application
of flannel bandages over the whole abdomen. In
chronic cases, and in convalescents, it appeared to be of the
greatest service; and, in recent cases, when the appropriate
remedies were used at the same time, it appeared to shorten
the cure. I have seen it tried alone but in a few cases of this
disease. From the result of these, however, in cases of either
the European or tropical dysentery, I would not venture to
rely on it alone for a cure.
</p>
<p>
Before leaving the subject of dysentery I may mention,
that, in India, I have met with some cases of a very violent dysentery
which ran its course in three, four, or five days. In
this disease the usual practice did not succeed. The best
treatment appeared to be, after a dose of castor oil, to give
opium liberally by the mouth, and by clyster; and to make
the patient drink very freely of gum arabic at the same time.
In some of these cases I have likewise given diluted nitric-acid.
A constriction of the vessels discharging mucus was in
this way effected; the incessant discharge was stopped, and
time given for a secretion of mucus to cover the abraded gut.
I have thus sometimes succeeded in checking a most violent
disease. Thereafter, the mouth could be gradually and gently
affected by mercury, or by nitric-acid.
</p>
<p>
On opening the bodies of those who died of the tropical
dysentery, in Egypt as in India, we almost constantly found the
liver diseased. In old cases, we likewise most commonly
found ulceration of the great intestines, and very frequently
within the reach of enemata. In the composition of these, a
variety of articles were used: most frequently, I think, solutions
of sugar of lead, or vitriolated zinc, gave greatest relief;
and we sometimes found that gum arabic, milk, and broths,
gave relief, when many other things had failed.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> It was soon afterwards introduced to India, by the exertions
of the Medical Board at Bombay; and the world has had

Dr Keir, who had the charge of the institution for disseminating
the vaccine disease, from Bombay through India.</p>

<h2 id="TABLE_I">TABLE I.</h2>

<p>I have said, that the similarity between a number of
the symptoms of the plague, and those of the destructive
fever which I saw in the West-Indian islands, in
1795 and 1796, struck me in Egypt. On my return to
India, having recourse to my papers and case-books,
written while I was in the West Indies, I found a very
great resemblance between the two diseases, as I had
seen them, in countries so remote. At Bombay, in conversation
with General Nicolls, who commanded at
Grenada while I was in that island, I mentioned the
resemblance of the two diseases, in very many of their
features, as being remarkable. At the general’s suggestion,
I soon after drew out, in a tabular form, the principal
points of resemblance between the plague and
the yellow fever. This table appeared curious to the
general, and to my ingenious and esteemed friend, Mr Scott,
as well as to other friends at Bombay; and, at
their desire, I appended it to my Memoir. I here subjoin
it in the abstract: it may suggest hints that might
be useful to future observers in the West-Indian fever
as well as in the plague.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
